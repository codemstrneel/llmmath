```python
def solution(n):
    # Calculate the number of bits in the binary representation of n
    bits = n.bit_length()
    
    # If there are less than 4 bits, return n as toggling isn't possible
    if bits < 4:
        return n
    
    # Toggle the middle bits
    mask = (1 << (bits - 3)) - 1
    return n ^ mask
