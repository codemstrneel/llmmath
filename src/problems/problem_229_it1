QUESTION

Write a function that takes a string consisting of multiple words and an integer n as input. Reverse the words in the string and then rotate the resulting list of words n places to the right. Return the final transformed string.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The failure in `test_rotation_exceeding_length` suggests that the expected behavior was misunderstood or incorrectly implemented. After reversing the words, the function should correctly handle rotations, and the tests must reflect the correct rotation logic. Let's review and correct the tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(input_string, n):
    """
    Reverses the words in the input string and then rotates the list of words n places to the right.
    
    Parameters:
    - input_string (str): A string consisting of multiple words.
    - n (int): The number of places to rotate the list of words to the right.
    
    Returns:
    - str: The transformed string.
    """
    words = input_string.split()  # Split the string into words
    if not words:
        return input_string
    
    reversed_words = words[::-1]  # Reverse the words
    n = n % len(reversed_words)  # Handle cases where n is larger than the number of words
    rotated_words = reversed_words[-n:] + reversed_words[:-n]  # Rotate the list of words
    return ' '.join(rotated_words)  # Join the words back into a string
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_example_case():
    assert solution("the quick brown fox", 2) == "quick the fox brown"

def test_single_word():
    assert solution("hello", 1) == "hello"
    assert solution("hello", 0) == "hello"
    assert solution("hello", 10) == "hello"

def test_no_rotation():
    assert solution("jump over the lazy dog", 0) == "dog lazy the over jump"

def test_full_rotation():
    assert solution("jump over the lazy dog", 5) == "dog lazy the over jump"
    assert solution("jump over the lazy dog", 10) == "dog lazy the over jump"

def test_empty_string():
    assert solution("", 5) == ""

def test_rotation_exceeding_length():
    # Reverse: four three two one
    # Rotate 10 places equivalent to rotating 2 places: two one four three
    assert solution("one two three four", 10) == "two one four three"

def test_all_words_rotated():
    assert solution("one two", 1) == "one two"
    assert solution("one two", 2) == "two one"
<|Test End|>

In the `test_rotation_exceeding_length`, the rotation of 10 gets reduced to a rotation of 2 due to modulo operation, so reversing "one two three four" results in "four three two one", and rotating this two places results in "two one four three". This matches the correction reflected in the test.
