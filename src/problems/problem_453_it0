QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and a number n as input. The function should generate all unique sublists of the given list where each sublist has a maximum length of 2, and then rotate each sublist to the right by n positions. If a sublist is rotated beyond its length, it should wrap around appropriately.
