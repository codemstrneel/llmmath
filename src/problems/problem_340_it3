QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two lists: the first list is a sorted numeric array with one extra element, and the second list is a list of tuples. Your function should find the index of the extra element in the first list compared to a sorted version of the second list that represents flattened numeric values from its elements. Additionally, while doing so, sort the list of tuples based on the sum of their elements using a lambda function. Return both the index of the extra element and the sorted list of tuples.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems like there were some errors with formatting in previous attempts due to extra markdown or code block identifiers. Let's provide a consolidated version without such issues.

The task involves identifying the extra element's index in the sorted list compared to the sorted flattened list from tuples and ensuring the tuples are sorted by the sum of their elements.

Here is the solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(sorted_list, tuple_list):
    """
    Finds the index of the extra element in sorted_list compared to the 
    flattened and sorted version of the tuple_list. Also sorts the 
    tuple_list based on the sum of each tuple's elements.

    :param sorted_list: A sorted list containing one extra element
    :param tuple_list: A list of tuples
    :return: A tuple containing the index of the extra element and 
             the sorted list of tuples based on the sum of their elements
    """
    # Flatten the tuple_list
    flattened_list = sorted(item for sublist in tuple_list for item in sublist)
    
    # Identify the index of the extra element in sorted_list
    index_of_extra = next(i for i in range(len(sorted_list)) 
                         if i >= len(flattened_list) or sorted_list[i] != flattened_list[i])
    
    # Sort the tuple_list based on the sum of each tuple's elements
    sorted_tuple_list = sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda x: sum(x))
    
    return index_of_extra, sorted_tuple_list
```
