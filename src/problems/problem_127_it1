QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains both integers and strings, and a tuple containing two integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each sublist, determine if the list contains an odd index with an odd number and if the first three integers form a valid triangle. If both conditions are met, and the perimeter of this triangle is odd, calculate the area using Heron's formula, rounded to two decimal places. Accumulate this area for all such conditions.

2. For each string in the sublist, extract any numeric values and increment them using the first integer from the tuple. If, after incrementation, all numeric values in the string are odd and the total string length (with only alphanumeric characters) does not exceed the second integer from the tuple, concatenate such strings from all sublists into one final string.

3. Return a dictionary with:
   - "triangle_areas": the total accumulated area of valid triangles with odd perimeters.
   - "filtered_concat": the concatenated string from step 2 which meets all specified conditions.

Assume that each sublist contains at least three integers and that strings contain only alphanumeric characters.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues with the current implementation and the tests to ensure that the function meets the problem's requirements and the tests verify the implementation correctly. 

Here's the corrected solution and test suite:

```python
import re
import math

def solution(list_of_lists, params):
    def is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
        return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a

    def calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c):
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        return round(area, 2)

    def extract_incremented_numbers(string, increment):
        numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', string)
        incremented_numbers = [int(num) + increment for num in numbers]
        return incremented_numbers

    def are_all_numbers_odd(numbers):
        return all(num % 2 != 0 for num in numbers)

    def alphanumeric_length(string):
        return len(re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z0-9]', string))

    triangle_areas = 0.0
    filtered_strings = []

    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Analyze sublist contents for triangle condition
        numbers = [x for x in sublist if isinstance(x, int)]
        strings = [x for x in sublist if isinstance(x, str)]
        
        # Check if a sublist contains an odd index with an odd number
        odd_index_odd_number = any((i % 2 != 0 and num % 2 != 0) for i, num in enumerate(numbers))
        
        # Check the triangle condition
        if len(numbers) >= 3:
            a, b, c = numbers[:3]
            if is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
                perimeter = a + b + c
                if odd_index_odd_number and perimeter % 2 != 0:
                    triangle_areas += calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c)

        # Process strings
        for string in strings:
            incremented_numbers = extract_incremented_numbers(string, params[0])
            if incremented_numbers and are_all_numbers_odd(incremented_numbers):
                if alphanumeric_length(string) <= params[1]:
                    filtered_strings.append(string)

    filtered_concat = ''.join(filtered_strings)

    return {
        "triangle_areas": triangle_areas,
        "filtered_concat": filtered_concat
    }

With these corrections, the implementation and tests should now correctly represent the task's requirements.
