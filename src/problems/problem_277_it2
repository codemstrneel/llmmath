QUESTION

Create a Python function that calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given non-negative integer.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's ensure the code and tests are formatted correctly and verify they fulfill the requirements for calculating the sum of the binomial coefficients using the formula \(2^n\). The previous attempts encountered execution errors due to incorrect block formatting. Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n):
    """
    Returns the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given non-negative integer n.
    This sum is equal to 2^n.
    """
    return 2 ** n
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_zero():
    assert solution(0) == 1

def test_solution_small_numbers():
    assert solution(1) == 2
    assert solution(2) == 4
    assert solution(3) == 8

def test_solution_medium_numbers():
    assert solution(10) == 1024

def test_solution_large_numbers():
    assert solution(20) == 1048576
    # Test an edge case with a larger n
    assert solution(50) == 1125899906842624

def test_solution_extremely_large_number():
    # Let's test an extremely large number to ensure the calculation handles big numbers
    assert solution(100) == 1267650600228229401496703205376
```
<|Test End|>

These tests verify that the solution correctly calculates the sum of binomial coefficients as \(2^n\) for various values of \(n\), including edge cases and extremely large numbers, leveraging Python's capability to handle large integers smoothly.
