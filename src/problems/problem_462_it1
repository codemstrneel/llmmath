QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of integers, and performs the following operations:

1. For each tuple, rotate its elements to the right by a specified number of positions, wrapping around as needed.
2. After rotation, identify the tuple with the maximum product of its first three elements. The tuples can contain both positive and negative numbers, and you should return an appropriate error if any tuple contains fewer than three elements.
3. If any tuple contains a `None` value, ignore it for the product calculation and only consider valid elements for rotation and product calculation.
4. Additionally, check if any month number equivalent to the maximum integer in the rotated tuples corresponds to a month that has 30 days. Return True if such a month is found, otherwise return False.

Ensure the function correctly handles the nested structure of input and can work with a list containing fewer than six tuples.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues found in the initial implementation and test cases.

## Observations:
- The function `solution` is throwing a `ValueError` in situations where it should not, particularly handling tuples with `None` values and determining their effective length.
- The rotation logic might be faulty when tuples contain `None` values, and further, maybe correct product handling is missing.
- The tests need to be adjusted as the assumptions made might be incorrect regarding these conditions.

Let's revise the solution and the test cases to address these issues.

- The solution now handles filtering and skipping of inappropriate tuples correctly.
- Tests have been adjusted to reflect possible edge conditions accurately.
