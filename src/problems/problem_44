QUESTION

Create a Python function that takes a two-dimensional list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains numerical values. The function should compute the following:

1. Identify the peak value for each dictionary using their numerical values. This is analogous to finding the maximum value in a periodic set of function values.
2. Sort the two-dimensional list based on the minimum total path sum of each row, where each total is computed by summing up the peak values from each dictionary in that row.
3. For each row, calculate the average peak value across the dictionaries and return it as part of the final output.

Ensure the overall function outputs a sorted list of these average peak values for the entire two-dimensional list.
