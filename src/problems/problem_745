QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that processes a list of strings, where each string contains a sequence of words and potential names. A name is defined as a sequence that starts with one or more uppercase letters followed by a series of lowercase letters. Your function should extract all names from the list that also form a palindrome when reversed. Additionally, for every such palindrome name found, exchange its position in the list with its subsequent name, if it exists. Utilize the collections module to return a dictionary where keys are the found palindrome names and values are the lists of corresponding names that were swapped. If a name has no subsequent name to swap with, it remains in its position. Your function should handle this intelligently without raising errors.

### Example

Given a list input:
```python
[
    "Anna went to see Otto",
    "Hannah has a kayak",
    "Elle was with Bob at the racecar event"
]
```

The function should return:
```python
{
    "Anna": ["Anna", "Otto"],
    "Elle": ["Elle", "Bob"],
}
```

**Note:**
- "Anna" is a palindrome and swaps with "Otto."
- "Elle" is a palindrome and swaps with "Bob."
- "Hannah" and "kayak" are ignored as they have no subsequent names to swap.
- The function should be robust, efficiently handling cases with multiple palindrome names within the same string.

SOL & TESTS

Sure, let's solve this problem. 

The task involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Names:** First, identify names within each string that match the criteria: starts with an uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters.

2. **Check for Palindromes:** Check if any of these names are palindromes.

3. **Swap Positions:** If a palindrome name is found, swap its position with the subsequent name, if any.

4. **Generate the Output:** Use collections to map each palindrome name to the list of names with which it was swapped.

Let's provide a complete solution following these steps.

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict

def process_names(string_list):
    def extract_names(line):
        # Use regex to find words that start with uppercase followed by lowercase letters
        return re.findall(r'\b[A-Z][a-z]+\b', line)

    def is_palindrome(word):
        return word == word[::-1]

    results = defaultdict(list)

    for line in string_list:
        names = extract_names(line)
        i = 0
        while i < len(names):
            if is_palindrome(names[i]):
                palindrome_name = names[i]
                if i + 1 < len(names):
                    # Swap current palindrome with the subsequent name
                    names[i], names[i + 1] = names[i + 1], names[i]
                    results[palindrome_name].append(names[i])
                # Increment by 2 if swap occurred, otherwise by 1
                i += 2
            else:
                i += 1

    return results

<|Test End|>

In this implementation, the function identifies names using a regular expression and checks for palindrome properties. If a palindrome is found, it swaps positions with the next name, if available. Finally, we collect the swap results in a dictionary using `defaultdict` and return it. The provided tests cover various scenarios including cases with no palindromes, multiple palindromes, and palindromes without available swaps.
