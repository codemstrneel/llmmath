QUESTION

Write a function to find the balancing point index of the given array. The balancing point index is defined as an index where the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right, excluding the element itself. If no such index exists, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's make the necessary adjustments to the solution and ensure the tests adequately cover possible scenarios.

Firstly, let's correct the errors in the solution and ensure it works for all cases. After that, we will write accurate unit tests.

### Correct Solution

The provided solution logic was correct, but let's re-implement it clearly to make sure it captures edge cases properly:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(arr):
    """
    Returns the balancing point index of the input array where the sum of elements
    on the left is equal to the sum of elements on the right.

    :param arr: List of integers
    :return: Balancing point index or -1 if no such index exists
    """
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    left_sum = 0
    
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if left_sum == (total_sum - left_sum - num):
            return i
        left_sum += num
    
    return -1
```
<|Solution End|>

### Refined Unit Tests

We need to ensure the tests are correct and comprehensive for various scenarios:

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_balancing_point_exists():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 6]) == 3  # 1+2+3 == 6
    assert solution([1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1]) == 3  # 1+1+1 == 1+1+1
    assert solution([10, 5, 5, 10]) == 2  # 10+5 == 5+10

def test_no_balancing_point():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3]) == -1  # No index can balance
    assert solution([1, 1, 1, 1]) == -1  # All parts identical but no balancing index

def test_balancing_point_at_edge():
    assert solution([0, 1, -1, 0]) == -1  # No balancing point
    assert solution([0]) == -1  # Single zero, no balancing point

def test_balancing_point_in_middle():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]) == 2  # 1+2 == 3+2+1

def test_single_element_array():
    assert solution([1]) == -1  # Single element, no balancing point

def test_symmetric_array():
    assert solution([1, 2, 1]) == 1  # Balanced at the middle
    assert solution([2, 2, 2, 2]) == -1  # Symmetric but no balancing point

def test_negative_and_positive_numbers():
    assert solution([-1, 3, -2, 3, -1]) == 2  # -1+3 == 3-1
    assert solution([-10, 20, -10]) == 1  # -10 == -10
```
<|Test End|>

The revised test cases now ensure comprehensive coverage of scenarios and test the functionality robustly.
