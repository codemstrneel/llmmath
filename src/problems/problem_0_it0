QUESTION

Write a function that creates a square matrix filled with the first n perfect squares, arranged in spiral order. After constructing the matrix, determine if the largest number in the matrix has the same number of digits as the smallest number, excluding zeros.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Sure, let's solve the problem step-by-step. We need to build a square matrix filled with perfect squares arranged in a spiral order and then determine if the largest and smallest numbers have the same number of digits (excluding zeros).

### Steps:
1. **Generate Perfect Squares**: We start by computing the first `n*n` perfect squares since we'll have an `n x n` matrix.
2. **Fill Matrix in Spiral Order**: We then place these squares into the matrix in a spiral pattern.
3. **Digit Count Check**: Finally, we check whether the largest and smallest numbers in the matrix (considering their non-zero digits) have the same number of digits.

Below is the solution including the function and its associated test cases.

```python
def solution(n):
    def generate_perfect_squares(size):
        """Generate a list of perfect squares up to size*size."""
        return [i*i for i in range(1, size*size + 1)]

    def fill_spiral(n, numbers):
        """Fill an n x n matrix in a spiral order with the given numbers."""
        if not numbers or n == 0:
            return []
        
        spiral_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        current_dir = 0
        r = c = 0
        
        for num in numbers:
            spiral_matrix[r][c] = num
            next_r, next_c = r + directions[current_dir][0], c + directions[current_dir][1]
            
            if 0 <= next_r < n and 0 <= next_c < n and spiral_matrix[next_r][next_c] == 0:
                r, c = next_r, next_c
            else:
                current_dir = (current_dir + 1) % 4
                r, c = r + directions[current_dir][0], c + directions[current_dir][1]
        
        return spiral_matrix

    def count_non_zero_digits(number):
        """Count non-zero digits in a number."""
        return len([d for d in str(number) if d != '0'])
    
    # Generate n*n perfect squares
    perfect_squares = generate_perfect_squares(n)
    
    # Fill the matrix in spiral order
    matrix = fill_spiral(n, perfect_squares)
    
    # Find the largest and smallest non-zero numbers
    largest = max(perfect_squares)
    smallest = min(perfect_squares)
    
    # Count non-zero digits
    largest_digits = count_non_zero_digits(largest)
    smallest_digits = count_non_zero_digits(smallest)
    
    # Determine if they have the same number of digits
    return largest_digits == smallest_digits
<|Solution End|>

<Test Begin>
```python
def test_solution_small_matrix():
    assert solution(1) == True  # The only number is 1, digits count is 1.

def test_solution_two_by_two_matrix():
    # Matrix: [ 1, 4 ]
    #         [ 9, 16 ]
    assert solution(2) == False  # Smallest is 1 (digits: 1), largest is 16 (digits: 2).

def test_solution_three_by_three_matrix():
    # Matrix: [  1,  4,  9 ]
    #         [ 36, 49, 16 ]
    #         [ 25, 64, 81 ]
    assert solution(3) == False  # Smallest is 1, largest is 81 (digits: 2).

def test_solution_zero_exclusion():
    # Matrix test to ensure zeros do not count: Includes varying sizes, no specific test case needed but structure caters for seamless operation.
    perfect_squares = [ i*i for i in range(1, 4*4 + 1) ]
    assert len(perfect_squares) == 16
    assert solution(4) == False

def test_solution_large_matrix():
    # Matrix: Very large; we analyze a subset of the structure
    assert solution(10) == False  # e.g., first check 1 then 100 pixels etc; typical grid pattern expected.
    assert len([i*i for i in range(1, 10*10 + 1)]) == 100

<Test End>
```
These tests will validate the matrix creation and check digit comparisons, ensuring the solution's robustness across varying scenarios.
