QUESTION

Create a function that takes two strings as input. Each string ends with a numeric representation, for instance: "abc123" or "xyz456". The function should extract these numbers, then calculate their sum raised to the power of the larger of the two numbers. Finally, return the sum of all the digits of this result.
