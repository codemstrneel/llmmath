QUESTION

Write a function that takes three parameters: an integer \( n \), a range of integers defined by two variables \( l \) and \( r \), and a list of lists where each sublist contains integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Calculate the sum of all positive even numbers that are less than or equal to \( n \).
2. For each sublist, compute the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, and sum all these differences.
3. Within the integer range defined by \( l \) and \( r \):
   - Check if each integer can be one angle of a valid triangle with any two elements from a sublist, where the sum of any two angles must be greater than the third angle.
4. Return a dictionary with two key-value pairs:
   - "even_sum": the sum of all positive even numbers calculated from step 1.
   - "triangle_count": the count of integers within the range \( l \) and \( r \) that can be one angle of a valid triangle with any two numbers taken from any sublist.
