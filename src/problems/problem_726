QUESTION

Write a Python function to count the total number of set bits in the binary representation of a given integer n.

SOL & TESTS

Sure! To solve the problem of counting the total number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of a given integer `n`, we can use a straightforward approach. One efficient method is to repeatedly check the least significant bit of the number, increment a counter if it's set (i.e., equals 1), and then right-shift the number by one bit until the number becomes zero.

Here's how you can implement this:

<|Solution Begin|> 
```python
def count_set_bits(n):
    """
    Returns the total number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of an integer n.
    
    :param n: Integer number
    :return: Total count of set bits in the binary representation of n
    """
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1
    return count
```
<|Solution End|>

Now, let's create some unit tests using pytest style to verify that our implementation is correct.

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import count_set_bits

def test_count_set_bits_positive():
    assert count_set_bits(5) == 2  # 5 is 101 in binary
    assert count_set_bits(7) == 3  # 7 is 111 in binary
    assert count_set_bits(8) == 1  # 8 is 1000 in binary

def test_count_set_bits_zero():
    assert count_set_bits(0) == 0  # 0 is 0 in binary

def test_count_set_bits_power_of_two():
    assert count_set_bits(16) == 1  # 16 is 10000 in binary
    assert count_set_bits(32) == 1  # 32 is 100000 in binary

def test_count_set_bits_large_number():
    assert count_set_bits(255) == 8  # 255 is 11111111 in binary
    assert count_set_bits(1023) == 10  # 1023 is 1111111111 in binary

def test_count_set_bits_negative_number():
    # To handle negative numbers, we should define behavior or use mask for bit-length; using mask for simplicity
    assert count_set_bits(-1 & 0xFFFFFFFF) == 32  # assuming 32-bit integers
    assert count_set_bits(-2 & 0xFFFFFFFF) == 31  # assuming 32-bit integers
```
<|Test End|>

These tests cover various cases, such as counting bits in positive numbers, zero, powers of two, and large numbers. For negative numbers, we adjust using a mask to present them as unsigned 32-bit integers since in Python, negative numbers have infinite leading ones in binary.
