QUESTION

Create a Python function that integrates concepts from coding questions 1 and 5.

Your task is to write a function that accepts the following inputs:
- A list of integers `numbers`
- A second list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  
The function should perform the following operations:
1. For each tuple, convert the integer \( a \) into a Roman numeral.
2. Rotate the `numbers` list to the left by the number of odd numbers present in the range from \( b \) to \( c \), inclusive. The rotation should be circular.
3. Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle using \( a \) as the width and \( b \) as the height for the current tuple.
4. Determine the product of all odd numbers in the rotated `numbers` list.
5. Find the remainder of the product from step 4 when divided by the rectangleâ€™s perimeter obtained in step 3.
6. Return a dictionary where the keys are the Roman numerals converted from each \( a \), and the values are the remainders calculated in step 5.

Note: Implement a helper function to handle the conversion of integers to Roman numerals, and another helper function to compute the rectangle's perimeter.
