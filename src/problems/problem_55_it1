QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of strings in camel case format, separates the strings into two lists based on whether the total number of characters in each string is odd or even, and then converts each string to snake case format using regex. Finally, return a tuple containing both lists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues in the test cases to make sure they properly evaluate the solution function. It seems there are some discrepancies in the expected lengths and categories (odd/even) of the strings. We will correct these accordingly.

### Adjustments Required:
- Ensure the calculated lengths in the test cases reflect the true lengths of the modified snake case strings.
- Adjust the tests to reflect these corrections.

Here is the corrected solution and test code:

<|Solution Begin|>
import re

def solution(camel_case_strings):
    """
    Converts camelCase strings to snake_case and separates them into two lists based on the total number of characters
    being odd or even.
    
    :param camel_case_strings: List of strings in camelCase format.
    :return: Tuple containing two lists - first list with snake_case strings of odd length, second list with snake_case strings of even length.
    """
    odd_length_snakes = []
    even_length_snakes = []

    for string in camel_case_strings:
        # Convert camelCase to snake_case using regex
        snake_case_string = re.sub(r'(?<!^)(?=[A-Z])', '_', string).lower()
        
        # Partition the snake_case strings into odd and even length lists
        if len(snake_case_string) % 2 == 0:
            even_length_snakes.append(snake_case_string)
        else:
            odd_length_snakes.append(snake_case_string)

    return (odd_length_snakes, even_length_snakes)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_odd_length_snakes():
    camel_case_strings = ["camelCase", "simpleTest", "anotherTestExample"]
    result = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert "camel_case" not in result[1]  # length is odd: 10
    assert "simple_test" not in result[0]  # length is even

def test_solution_even_length_snakes():
    camel_case_strings = ["test", "simpleTest"]
    result = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert "test" in result[1]  # length is even: 4
    assert "simple_test" in result[0]  # length is odd: 11

def test_solution_mixed_lengths():
    camel_case_strings = ["simplePhrase", "AnotherOne"]
    odd_result, even_result = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert "simple_phrase" in even_result   # length is even: 13
    assert "another_one" in even_result     # length is even: 12

def test_solution_empty_list():
    camel_case_strings = []
    result = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert isinstance(result, tuple)
    assert result == ([], [])

def test_solution_single_word_snakes():
    camel_case_strings = ["Word", "AnotherWord"]
    result = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert "word" in result[1]  # length is even: 4
    assert "another_word" in even_result  # length is even: 12

def test_solution_no_uppercase_snakes():
    camel_case_strings = ["nocamelcase"]
    result = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert "nocamelcase" in result[0]  # length is odd: 11
<|Test End|>

These changes rectify the tests alignment with the problem requirements, ensuring correct categorization of strings based on their lengths.
