QUESTION

Write a function that rotates a single list by a specified number of items to the left, then checks if there is any element whose rightmost set bit matches the rightmost set bit of any other element in the rotated list. If such elements exist, return the sum of their indices in the original list. If no such elements exist, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Given the issues observed in the previous attempts, let's refine the solution and the unit tests to properly address the task requirements.

### Revised Solution
The key error in the previous solution was the improper handling of the rightmost set bit logic and the summing of indices. 

1. **Rotation**: Correctly rotate the list using modulus to ensure k is within bounds.
2. **Matching Rightmost Set Bit**: Compare the rightmost set bit values correctly.
3. **Correct Index Summation**: Accumulate indices of the original positions when rightmost bits match.

Let's correct the code accordingly:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(lst, k):
    """
    Rotates the list to the left by k elements and finds if there is any element 
    whose rightmost set bit matches the rightmost set bit of any other element 
    in the rotated list. If such elements exist, returns the sum of their 
    indices in the original list. If no such elements exist, returns -1.
    """
    if not lst:
        return -1
    
    # Rotate the list to the left by k elements
    n = len(lst)
    k %= n
    rotated = lst[k:] + lst[:k]

    def rightmost_set_bit(x):
        # Returns the power of two that is the rightmost set bit of x
        return x & -x

    bit_to_indices = {}

    # Mapping from the rightmost bit to the sum of indices
    for idx, num in enumerate(rotated):
        r_bit = rightmost_set_bit(num)
        if r_bit in bit_to_indices:
            bit_to_indices[r_bit].append(idx)
        else:
            bit_to_indices[r_bit] = [idx]

    # Checking for matching rightmost bits
    for indices in bit_to_indices.values():
        if len(indices) > 1:
            # Sum the original indices of matching elements
            return sum(lst.index(rotated[i]) for i in indices)

    return -1
<|Solution End|>
```

### Revised Unit Tests
Modify the tests to align with the expected behavior of the function.

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_single_rotation_with_match():
    # 2 and 8 both have rightmost set bit 2^1
    assert solution([2, 4, 8], 1) == 0 + 2

def test_single_rotation_no_match():
    # No two numbers share the rightmost set bit
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 1) == -1

def test_full_rotation_with_match():
    # Complete rotation back to original, check for match
    assert solution([2, 4, 8], 3) == 0 + 2

def test_full_rotation_no_match():
    # Complete rotation back to original, but no match
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) == -1

def test_empty_list():
    # Empty list should return -1
    assert solution([], 3) == -1

def test_single_element():
    # Single element cannot match with anything else
    assert solution([10], 0) == -1
    assert solution([10], 1) == -1

def test_large_k_value():
    # Large k value but same rightmost bit match
    assert solution([2**2, 2**3, 2**2, 2**4], 1000) == 0 + 2

def test_elements_with_same_rightmost_bit():
    # Multiple elements have the same rightmost set bit
    assert solution([16, 8, 4, 2], 2) == 0 + 1 + 2

def test_match_at_end_of_rotation():
    # Match through rotation
    assert solution([4, 8, 16, 32], 2) == 0 + 2
<|Test End|>
```

This revised solution and test set should correctly address the task requirements.
