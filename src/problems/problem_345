QUESTION

New Question: Create a function that processes a list of tuples, each containing a word and a number. The function should sort the tuples based on the number in ascending order. Then, select the tuple with the smallest number and count the occurrence of a specified character in the word from that tuple.

def process_tuples(tuples_list, char_to_count):

    :param tuples_list: List of tuples, where each tuple is (word, number).
    :param char_to_count: Character to count in the word of the smallest numbered tuple.
    :return: Integer count of the specified character.

    # Take the first tuple after sorting
