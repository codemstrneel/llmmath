QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of integer tuples and an integer \( n \) and returns a new list according to the following transformations:

1. **Filtering Stage:** Remove any tuple that includes an integer below zero.
2. **Transformation Stage:** For each remaining tuple, clear the value of each integer by resetting it to 0 if the sum of the tuple is not divisible by \( n \).
3. **Chunking and Reordering Stage:** Split the list of transformed tuples into chunks of size \( n \). Within each chunk, reorder the tuples based on the sum of their original values, placing tuples with higher sums first.
4. **Final Aggregation Stage:** For each chunk, return the sum of lengths of the tuples within that chunk, along with the reordered tuples.

Examples:
- Given the list of tuples `[(3, 4), (-1, 5), (6, 2)]` and a chunk size of 2, the process first filters out the tuple `(-1, 5)`, transforms, and rearranges the remaining tuples into chunks, and produces the final output.
- Given the integers `[(3, 5), (10, 0), (2, 6), (9, 1)]` with \( n \) as 2, follow through the stages to produce a result.

This new question combines the following concepts from your questions:

- **From Question 1:** Clearing or resetting values.
- **From Question 2:** Performing chunking operations.
- **From Question 5:** Using filtering logic based on specific conditions.

This question introduces novel programming challenges by combining filtering, condition-based transformations, chunking, and reordering operations.

SOL & TESTS

```<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def filter_transform_reorder(tuples, n):
    """
    Apply a series of transformations to a list of integer tuples.
    
    Parameters:
    - tuples: List of tuples with integers.
    - n: Integer, used as a divisor and chunk size.
    
    Returns:
    A list of tuples, each containing two elements:
      1) The sum of lengths of tuples in the chunk.
      2) List of tuples in the chunk, reordered by their original sums in descending order.
    """

    # Filtering Stage: Remove tuples with negative integers
    filtered_tuples = [t for t in tuples if all(x >= 0 for x in t)]

    # Transformation Stage: Reset integers to 0 if tuple's sum is not divisible by n
    transformed_tuples = [(t if sum(t) % n == 0 else tuple(0 for _ in t)) for t in filtered_tuples]

    # Chunking and Reordering Stage
    # Order each chunk by original sums in descending order
    chunks = []
    for i in range(0, len(transformed_tuples), n):
        chunk = transformed_tuples[i:i + n]

        original_sums = [(t, sum(original)) for t, original in zip(chunk, filtered_tuples[i:i + n])]
        sorted_chunk = [t for t, _ in sorted(original_sums, key=lambda x: -x[1])]
        chunks.append((sum(len(t) for t in sorted_chunk), sorted_chunk))

    return chunks
