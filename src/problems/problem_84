QUESTION

Write a Python function that calculates the sum of the nth column of a 2D list where each element is given by the (i, j)th Bell number. The function should be optimized to handle cases where the size of the 2D list can be as large as 1,000 x 1,000 and n can be as large as 1,000.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this task, the solution involves calculating the sum of the `n`th column of a 2D list where each element corresponds to a Bell number. The Bell numbers represent a sequence where each number corresponds to the number of ways a set of n elements can be partitioned into non-empty subsets. We leverage this property to fill out our table of Bell numbers and obtain the needed sum. Here's how it can be translated into Python code:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n, size):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the nth column in a 2D list described by Bell numbers.

    :param n: The column index to sum (where columns are 0-indexed)
    :param size: The dimensions of the 2D list (it is size x size)
    :return: The sum of the nth column
    """
    if n < 0 or n >= size:
        return 0

    bell = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)]
    bell[0][0] = 1

    for i in range(1, size):
        bell[i][0] = bell[i - 1][i - 1]

        for j in range(1, size):
            bell[i][j] = bell[i - 1][j - 1] + bell[i][j - 1]

    column_sum = sum(bell[i][n] for i in range(n, size))
    return column_sum
<|Solution End|>

The function `solution(n, size)` calculates the sum of the nth column in a table of Bell numbers of dimensions `size x size`.

The unit tests for this function need to ensure that the calculation of the column sums based on Bell numbers is correct:

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_bell_numbers_small():
    assert solution(0, 3) == 1
    assert solution(1, 3) == 1
    assert solution(2, 3) == 2
    # Bell numbers for n = 0, 1, 2 should be 1, 1, 2, respectively
    assert solution(0, 4) == 1
    assert solution(1, 4) == 2
    assert solution(2, 4) == 5
    assert solution(3, 4) == 15  # Bell number 3rd is 15

def test_bell_numbers_large():
    assert solution(10, 15) == 115975

def test_out_of_bounds():
    assert solution(-1, 5) == 0
    assert solution(5, 5) == 0
    assert solution(6, 5) == 0

def test_large_size():
    # Test that the function can handle large sizes like 1000x1000
    assert solution(0, 1000) == 1  # First column should always be 1

<|Test End|>

These tests ensure that the solution covers various scenarios such as small examples, boundary conditions, and handling large sizes as specified in the task.
