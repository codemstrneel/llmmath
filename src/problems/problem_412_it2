QUESTION

Create a function that operates on a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains a "values" key associated with a list of integers and a "date" key with a value in the "YYYY-MM-DD" format. The function should identify dictionaries that meet the following two criteria:

1. The product of the integers in "values" is divisible by the sum of the year, month, and day extracted from the "date".
2. The list of integers in "values" should have the minimum number of even numbers compared to other dictionaries that meet the first criterion.

After filtering the dictionaries based on these criteria, sort the resulting dictionaries in descending order based on the product of the integers. If two dictionaries have the same product, prioritize those with fewer even numbers. If still tied, use alphabetical order of the original "date" for sorting.

Return the sorted list of dictionaries.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's refine the solution and test cases to address the issues and syntactical errors from previous attempts. The test cases need to represent realistic data and match the problem's requirements consistently.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(dicts):
    from datetime import datetime
    
    def product(numbers):
        result = 1
        for number in numbers:
            result *= number
        return result
    
    def count_evens(numbers):
        return sum(1 for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0)

    filtered_dicts = []

    for d in dicts:
        date = datetime.strptime(d['date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
        values = d['values']
        prod = product(values)
        date_sum = date.year + date.month + date.day
        if date_sum > 0 and prod % date_sum == 0:
            filtered_dicts.append((d, prod, count_evens(values)))
    
    if not filtered_dicts:
        return []

    min_evens = min(filtered_dicts, key=lambda x: x[2])[2]
    filtered_dicts = [(d, prod) for d, prod, evens in filtered_dicts if evens == min_evens]
    
    sorted_dicts = sorted(filtered_dicts, key=lambda x: (-x[1], count_evens(x[0]['values']), x[0]['date']))

    return [d for d, _ in sorted_dicts]
```

These adjustments ensure that test conditions align with the requirements, and the code is formatted without syntactical errors.
