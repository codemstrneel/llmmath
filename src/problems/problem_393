QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a function that takes a complex data structure consisting of nested lists and tuples. Each element in these structures is a string representing a float. The function should:

1. Convert each string element to a float.
2. For each float, compute its x-th power, where x is the index of its parent list or tuple in a previously provided sequence. If the parent is at the first level, x should be considered as 1.
3. Simultaneously, add the result of the power operation with its adjacent values within the same list or tuple, if any, and maintain the initial structure (e.g., process adjacent elements while retaining the structural hierarchy).
4. Return a new structure of the same type (list or tuple) but with each float processed according to the above steps, and ensure all final results are integers.

Utilize recursion, lambda expressions, and Python's functional programming tools like `map` to accomplish this task. Ensure the function robustly handles deeply nested structures, mixed data types, and maintains the structure's order and type throughout the transformations.

```python
def process_nested_structure(data, depth=1):
    def convert_and_compute(value, index, depth):
        """Convert string to float, compute its power and round to int"""
        float_val = float(value)
        powered_val = float_val ** depth
        return round(powered_val)

    def process_structure(struct, depth):
        """Recursively process the nested lists/tuples"""
        # Determine if structure is a tuple, to maintain it
        is_tuple = isinstance(struct, tuple)

        # Processing the current structure using recursion
        processed = [
            convert_and_compute(val, i, depth) 
            if isinstance(val, str) else process_structure(val, depth + 1) 
            for i, val in enumerate(struct)
        ]

        # Combine adjacent values and maintain the nested structure type
        combined = [
            processed[i] + processed[i + 1] 
            for i in range(len(processed) - 1)
        ]

        # Depending on the structure type, return a list or a tuple
        result = list(combined) + [processed[-1]] if len(processed) % 2 != 0 else combined
        if is_tuple:
            return tuple(result)
        return result

    return process_structure(data, depth)
