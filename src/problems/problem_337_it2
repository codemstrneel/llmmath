QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and checks if replacing the first digit of each number with the first digit of its factorial results in an increasing sequence. Use recursion to calculate factorials and map function to apply the transformation to each number in the list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues with your solution and tests based on the requirements. We need to correct the imports, fix any errors related to syntax, and ensure the logic is implemented as expected.

## Revised Solution and Tests

1. Ensure that the code can be executed without syntax errors.
2. Verify that the tests are correct and valid according to the solution's logic.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Recursively calculates the factorial of a given number n.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

def replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(number):
    """
    Replaces the first digit of the input number with the first digit
    of the factorial of the first digit of the number.
    """
    str_number = str(number)
    first_digit = int(str_number[0])
    first_digit_factorial = factorial(first_digit)
    first_digit_of_factorial = str(first_digit_factorial)[0]
    new_number = first_digit_of_factorial + str_number[1:]
    return int(new_number)

def solution(numbers):
    """
    Transforms each number in the list by replacing its first digit with the
    first digit of the factorial of its first digit and checks if the resulting sequence is strictly increasing.
    """
    transformed_numbers = list(map(replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit, numbers))
    return all(earlier < later for earlier, later in zip(transformed_numbers, transformed_numbers[1:]))
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit, solution

def test_replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit():
    assert replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(23) == 63
    assert replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(89) == 49  # factorial of 8 is 40320, first digit is 4
    assert replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(412) == 212  # factorial of 4 is 24, first digit is 2

def test_solution_increasing_sequence():
    assert solution([23, 45, 67]) == True  # first digit factorials: (6, 24, 720) -> transform: 63, 45, 67
    assert solution([12, 45, 122]) == True  # first digit factorials: (1, 24, 720) -> transform: 12, 45, 122

def test_solution_non_increasing_sequence():
    assert solution([321, 45, 4]) == False  # (first digit factorials: 6, 24, 24) -> transform: 621, 45, 4
    assert solution([23, 22, 21]) == False  # (first digit factorials: 6, 2, 2) -> transform: 63, 22, 21

def test_solution_edge_cases():
    assert solution([1]) == True  # single element sequence is trivially considered increasing
    assert solution([2, 0]) == False  # 0 factorial is 1 -> transform: 2, 1 (not increasing)
```
<|Test End|>

The solution and tests should now be correctly implemented and free of syntax errors, focusing on recursive factorial calculation and proper test verification. The tests ensure behavior on individual elements and entire arrays with edge and typical cases. The imports are assumed to be within a proper test environment structure.
