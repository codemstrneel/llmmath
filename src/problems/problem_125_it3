QUESTION

Write a function to group and sort the 1st elements in ascending order, based on the 2nd elements in the given tuple list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that processes a list of tuples, sorting them based on the second element of each tuple. After sorting, we should extract and return a list of the first elements from each tuple, in the order determined by the sorting of the second elements.

Here's how you would implement this:

1. Sort the list of tuples using the second element as the key.
2. Extract the first elements from the sorted list of tuples.
3. Return the list of first elements.

We will also provide unit tests to validate the solution.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(tuples_list):
    """
    Sort the tuples by the second element and return a list of the first elements 
    in the sorted order.

    :param tuples_list: List[Tuple[Any, Any]] - a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements
    :return: List[Any] - a list of the first elements of the tuples sorted by the second element
    """
    sorted_tuples = sorted(tuples_list, key=lambda x: x[1])
    return [x[0] for x in sorted_tuples]
<|Solution End|>
```

Now, let's write the unit tests to verify the solution.

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_single_tuple():
    assert solution([(1, 2)]) == [1]

def test_sorted_by_second_element():
    input_data = [(5, 1), (4, 2), (3, 3)]
    expected = [5, 4, 3]
    assert solution(input_data) == expected

def test_unsorted_tuples():
    input_data = [(1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 2)]
    expected = [3, 2, 1]
    assert solution(input_data) == expected

def test_duplicates_in_second_element():
    input_data = [(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)]
    expected = [1, 2, 3]
    assert solution(input_data) == expected

def test_negative_numbers_in_second_element():
    input_data = [(1, -1), (2, -2), (3, -3)]
    expected = [3, 2, 1]
    assert solution(input_data) == expected

def test_mixed_numbers_in_second_element():
    input_data = [(1, 0), (2, -2), (3, 2)]
    expected = [2, 1, 3]
    assert solution(input_data) == expected

<|Test End|>
```

These tests verify that the function:

- Handles single tuple input.
- Sorts tuples based on the second element correctly.
- Handles lists with unsorted tuples.
- Manages tuples with duplicate second elements.
- Works with negative numbers and varied number types in the second position.
