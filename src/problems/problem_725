QUESTION

Create a Python function that processes a list of mixed elements, which may include strings, numbers, and lists, with the following operations:

1. Identify and extract sequences within the list that consist of a single digit followed by one or more letter characters. Use regular expressions to find these sequences and store them in a separate list.

2. For every pair of numbers in the original list, toggle all bits except for the first and last bit for each number. If there is an odd number of numbers, leave the last one in its original position.

3. Sort the list of extracted sequences in alphabetical order and the list of toggled numbers in ascending order. Use a custom sorting function that handles both cases appropriately.

4. Concatenate all the sorted sequences into a single string, ensuring that duplicate sequences are removed while preserving the order of their first occurrence. Use the `collections` module to assist with this.

5. Append the sorted list of toggled numbers to a dictionary under the key "toggled_numbers" and the concatenated string under the key "sequences_string".

6. Return the dictionary with both the concatenated string and sorted toggled numbers.

This question combines elements of string extraction and manipulation, bitwise operations, sorting with custom criteria, and data structure management using dictionaries and the `collections` module.

SOL & TESTS

## Solution

The following function `process_mixed_elements` will perform the required operations as described in the problem:

```python
import re
from collections import OrderedDict

def toggle_bits(n):
    """
    Toggles all bits of a number `n` except the first and last bit.
    """
    bit_length = n.bit_length()
    # Create a mask that keeps the first and last bits unchanged
    mask = (1 << (bit_length - 1)) | 1
    # XOR n with all 1s of the bit_length, then restore first and last bits
    return ((~n) & ((1 << bit_length) - 1)) | (n & mask)

def process_mixed_elements(input_list):
    """
    Processes a list of mixed elements and returns a dictionary containing:
    - Concatenated string of sequences made of a single digit followed by letters.
    - Sorted list of processed numbers with toggled bits.
    """
    sequences = set()
    numbers = []

    for element in input_list:
        if isinstance(element, str):
            # Extract sequences using regex
            matches = re.findall(r'\d+[a-zA-Z]+', element)
            sequences.update(matches)
        elif isinstance(element, int):
            # Collect numbers
            numbers.append(element)

    # Toggle bits in numbers, leaving the last in its original form if odd count
    toggled_numbers = []
    for i in range(0, len(numbers) - len(numbers) % 2, 2):
        toggled_numbers.extend([toggle_bits(numbers[i]), toggle_bits(numbers[i + 1])])
    if len(numbers) % 2 == 1:
        toggled_numbers.append(numbers[-1])

    # Remove duplicates while preserving order
    sequences = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(sorted(sequences)))

    # Concatenate the sequences into one string
    sequences_string = ''.join(sequences)
    
    # Create the result dictionary
    result = {
        "sequences_string": sequences_string,
        "toggled_numbers": sorted(toggled_numbers)
    }
    
    return result
```

## Unit Tests

Here are the unit tests for the solution using `pytest`:

```python
from solution import process_mixed_elements

def test_example_case():
    input_data = ["1a", "2bc", "5xyz", 3, 10, "7x", 8]
    expected = {'sequences_string': '1a2bc5xyz7x', 'toggled_numbers': [1, 3, 11, 12]}
    assert process_mixed_elements(input_data) == expected

def test_no_numbers():
    input_data = ["1a", "2bc", "5xyz", "7x"]
    expected = {'sequences_string': '1a2bc5xyz7x', 'toggled_numbers': []}
    assert process_mixed_elements(input_data) == expected

def test_no_sequences():
    input_data = [3, 10, 8]
    expected = {'sequences_string': '', 'toggled_numbers': [1, 3, 12]}
    assert process_mixed_elements(input_data) == expected

def test_with_duplicate_sequences():
    input_data = ["1a", "1a", "2bc", "5xyz", 3, 10, "7x", 8, "5xyz"]
    expected = {'sequences_string': '1a2bc5xyz7x', 'toggled_numbers': [1, 3, 11, 12]}
    assert process_mixed_elements(input_data) == expected

def test_odd_numbers():
    input_data = [10, 15, 7]
    expected = {'sequences_string': '', 'toggled_numbers': [0, 5, 7]}
    assert process_mixed_elements(input_data) == expected

def test_no_elements():
    input_data = []
    expected = {'sequences_string': '', 'toggled_numbers': []}
    assert process_mixed_elements(input_data) == expected
```

These tests cover various scenarios including the presence of both numbers and sequences, cases with duplicates, and corner cases such as empty lists or lists with no sequences or numbers.
