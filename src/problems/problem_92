QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of tuples and a string as inputs. The string consists of words that may or may not begin with capital letters. The function should first put spaces between words starting with capital letters using regular expressions. Then, for each tuple in the list, check if the length of the newly formed string is present within the tuple. If it is, calculate the nth Bell number, where n is the length of the string, only if the number of words in the string is even. If the number of words is odd, compute the sum of the digits of the total surface area of a cone with radius and height given by the first two numbers in the tuple. Return a list of these results for each tuple.

SOLUTION/TESTS

## Solution:
The solution involves using regular expressions to process the given input string and determining the appropriate calculation based on the properties of each tuple and the characteristics of the string.

1. **Processing the String:** Use a regular expression to insert spaces before capital letters, except at the start of the string.
2. **Checking Tuple Conditions:** For each tuple, check if the length of the modified string is present within it.
3. **Perform Calculations:** 
   - If the number of words in the string is even, calculate the nth Bell number.
   - If the number of words is odd, compute the sum of the digits of the total surface area of a cone using the radius and height from the tuple.

Let's proceed with the implementation followed by the unit tests.

    bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)]
    bell[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]
    return bell[n][0]

    base_area = pi * radius * radius
    lateral_area = pi * radius * (radius**2 + height**2)**0.5
    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_area
    return total_surface_area

    results = []
    for t in tuples_list:
        length_of_string = len(spaced_string.replace(" ", ""))
        if length_of_string in t:
            if words_count % 2 == 0:
                results.append(bell_number(length_of_string))
            else:
                radius, height = t[0], t[1]
                surface_area = surface_area_of_cone(radius, height)
                results.append(sum_of_digits(int(surface_area)))
    return results
