QUESTION

Write a Python function to sort the characters in a given string in ascending order.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems the revised solution and tests are encountering issues with `test_solution_mixed_case`. The sorting was intended to be case-insensitive for ordering purposes, but the current implementation doesn't reflect the expected output. Let's address this now.

### Solution Code
I'm going to revise the solution so that characters are sorted in a case-insensitive way but maintain original case order for equivalent characters.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(s):
    """
    Sorts the characters in a given string in a case-insensitive manner,
    but maintains the original case of characters in the result.

    Args:
    - s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    - str: A new string with characters sorted in ascending order,
      treating uppercase and lowercase as equivalent.
    """
    return ''.join(sorted(s, key=lambda c: (c.lower(), c)))
<|Solution End|>

### Unit Test Code
With the key sorting change in place, I'll ensure the test for mixed cases adheres to the new sorting logic.

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_solution_sorted_string():
    assert solution('edcba') == 'abcde'

def test_solution_empty_string():
    assert solution('') == ''

def test_solution_single_character():
    assert solution('a') == 'a'

def test_solution_identical_characters():
    assert solution('aaaa') == 'aaaa'

def test_solution_alphanumeric():
    assert solution('a1b2c3') == '123abc'

def test_solution_special_characters():
    assert solution('!@#$') == '!#$@'

def test_solution_mixed_case():
    assert solution('bBbaA') == 'AaBb'

def test_solution_long_string():
    input_str = 'thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog'
    expected_output = 'abcdeeefghhijklmnoooopqrrsttuuvwxyz'
    assert solution(input_str) == expected_output
<|Test End|>

The above code should ensure case-insensitive sorting while maintaining original input case for characters with the same lowercase equivalence. Let's see how this revised version performs in the code execution environment.
