QUESTION

Write a function that rotates a given list of strings by a specified number of positions to the left. Then, for each string in the rotated list, use regex to find and return the starting index of all occurrences of a specific substring within each string.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The solution to the problem was already correctly implemented, but there were syntax errors in how the last attempt was presented in the markdown (specifically, Python code should not include redundant triple backticks inside the code block). I will correct the formatting errors and also update the test cases since they had incorrect expectations based on the problem description. The task is to rotate arrays and find substring occurrences, and the tests should reflect this behavior more accurately.

Here is the correct solution and test implementations:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import re
from typing import List

def solution(strings: List[str], rotate_by: int, substring: str) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Rotates a given list of strings by 'rotate_by' positions to the left.
    For each string in the rotated list, finds the starting index of all 
    occurrences of 'substring' using regex.
    """
    n = len(strings)
    if n == 0:
        return []

    # Step 1: Rotate the list of strings to the left by 'rotate_by'
    rotated_strings = strings[rotate_by % n:] + strings[:rotate_by % n]

    # Step 2: Find all occurrences of 'substring' in each rotated string
    result = []
    for string in rotated_strings:
        matches = [match.start() for match in re.finditer(re.escape(substring), string)]
        result.append(matches)

    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_rotate_and_find_substring_occurrences():
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 1, "a") == [[1, 3], [1]]
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 2, "e") == [[4], []]
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 0, "n") == [[], [2], []]
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 3, "a") == [[0], [1, 3]]

def test_edge_cases():
    assert solution([], 2, "a") == []
    assert solution(["abcd"], 1, "") == [list(range(4))]  # Should match every position before every character
    assert solution(["a", "b", "c"], 5, "a") == [[0], [], []]
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 1, "z") == [[], []]

def test_no_occurrences():
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 1, "z") == [[], []]
    
def test_multiple_occurrences():
    assert solution(["banana", "apple", "banana"], 2, "an") == [[1, 3], [1, 3]]
    
def test_rotation_with_repeated_patterns():
    assert solution(["abc", "def", "abc"], 2, "abc") == [[0], [0]]
```

### Explanation
- The rotation operation correctly handles cases where the `rotate_by` value is greater than the list length by using modulo.
- Regular expression searches are accurately performed, taking care to escape the substring.
- Tests cover edge cases such as empty lists and substrings, rotational equivalence, and various substring positions.
