QUESTION

**New Question:**

Design a Python function that performs operations related to lines and dictionaries. This function should take two arguments: a list of points, each represented as a tuple of coordinates `(x, y)`, and a list of dictionaries. The function will perform the following tasks:

1. **Slopes and Line Orientation**:
    - Calculate the slope of the line for every consecutive pair of points in the list.
    - Determine if each line segment is horizontal, vertical, or neither.

2. **Dictionary Analysis**:
    - For each dictionary in the list, determine if the number of key-value pairs is equal to the number of line segments (from the list of points). Use the `map` and `lambda` functions for this task.
    - If a dictionary has a key-value count equal to the number of line segments, compute the sum of the absolute values of all slopes and add it as a new key `slopeSum`. 

3. **Combination of Results**:
    - Return a tuple containing:
      - A list of string indications for each line segment ("horizontal", "vertical", or "neither").
      - The modified list of dictionaries.

**Example**:
```python
points = [(1, 2), (3, 2), (5, 6), (5, 1)]
dictionaries = [{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"x": 7, "y": 8, "z": 9}]

result = process_lines_and_dictionaries(points, dictionaries)
print(result)
```

**Expected Output**:
- A list of line orientations based on consecutive points.
- The dictionaries with updated fields if applicable.
