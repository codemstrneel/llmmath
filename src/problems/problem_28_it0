QUESTION

Write a python function to determine if a given integer can be represented as the sum of multiples of two square numbers, with each multiple being a polite number.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve the problem of determining whether a given integer can be represented as the sum of multiples of two square numbers, where each multiple is a polite number, we need to clarify a few concepts:

1. **Square Numbers**: These are numbers that can be expressed as \( n^2 \), where \( n \) is an integer.
2. **Polite Numbers**: A polite number is a positive integer that is not a power of 2. In other words, a polite number has at least one odd factor greater than 1.
3. **Representation**: The task is to check if an integer \( x \) can be decomposed as \( x = a \cdot p + b \cdot q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are perfect square numbers and \( a, b \) are polite numbers.

The solution will involve iterating over possible squares \( p \) and \( q \), checking if the remainder can be decomposed by a polite number. The solution checks combinations to ensure polite multiples of these squares sum to the target.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def is_polite_number(n):
    """
    Returns True if n is a polite number.
    """
    return n & (n - 1) != 0

def solution(x):
    """
    Determines if the given integer x can be represented as the sum of the multiples of two square numbers
    where each multiple is a polite number.
    """
    if x <= 0:
        return False
    
    max_square_root = int(x**0.5)
    for i in range(1, max_square_root + 1):
        p = i**2
        for j in range(1, max_square_root + 1):
            q = j**2
            for a in range(1, x // p + 1):
                if not is_polite_number(a):
                    continue
                remaining = x - a * p
                if remaining < 0:
                    break
                b = remaining // q
                if remaining % q == 0 and b > 0 and is_polite_number(b):
                    return True
    return False
<|Solution End|>
```

```python
<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_polite_case():
    # 10 can be expressed as 2 * 1^2 + 2 * 2^2 
    assert solution(10) == True

def test_solution_non_polite_case():
    # 17 is a prime and cannot be expressed with such a representation properly
    assert solution(17) == False

def test_solution_negative_or_zero_input():
    # Negative numbers and zero cannot be expressed as a sum of positive integers
    assert solution(0) == False
    assert solution(-5) == False

def test_solution_small_polite_case():
    # 13 can be expressed as 2*1^2 + 3*2^2
    assert solution(13) == True

def test_solution_large_polite_case():
    # A larger number which can be decomposed properly.
    assert solution(34) == True

def test_solution_edge_case_square_number():
    # Square number test case, like 16, should return True (2*2^2 + 2*2^2 with polite numbers).
    assert solution(16) == True
<|Test End|>
```

The solution iteratively checks all possible values using the constraints given by the task, ensuring all constraints of polite numbers and squares are met when forming the target number.
