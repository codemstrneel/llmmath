QUESTION

Create a function that takes a dictionary and an integer n as input. The dictionary has strings as keys and lists of integers as values. The function should first compute the sum of the integers in each list and find the highest product of two sums among all the lists. Then for each original list, replicate that list's sum n times, and add these replicated sums to a list. Return a tuple containing this list and the highest product previously calculated.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears the solution function is almost correct, but there may still be problems handling negative values correctly. Let's discuss some improvements:

The problem seems to lie in providing proper handling for negative sums and their products. We should ensure that the calculation performed during the product evaluation correctly treats sum pairs, including scenarios where sums are negative.

Upon further review, the `float('-inf')` is used to indicate a scenario where no valid product exists (e.g., fewer than two sums), and care should be taken to properly test product calculations even with negative sums.

Below is a revised solution and tests to correct the handling of negative values more robustly.

This set of corrections should ensure the solution gracefully handles both positive and negative sums, reporting products accurately.
