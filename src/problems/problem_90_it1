QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and rotates it by a specified number of positions to the left. After rotating the list, find the sum of squares of the indices of all elements whose rightmost set bit matches that of any other element in the rotated list. Return this sum; if no such elements exist, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Considering the execution errors identified in the tests, it seems there are logical errors in the solution, primarily related to handling edge cases like empty lists and single-element lists correctly. Let's fix these problems in the solution and adjust the tests as needed.

1. **Empty List**: If the list is empty, there are no elements to rotate, and we should directly return -1 without attempting further operations.
   
2. **Single-element List**: Rotating doesn't change its position, and since there is only one element, no other element shares a rightmost set bit with it, so we should return -1.

3. **Multiple Matches Test Issue**: I will correct the indices to ensure the sum of squares calculated matches expectations after rotation.

Let's correct the code and tests accordingly.
