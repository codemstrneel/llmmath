QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) where each sublist represents a row of the matrix, and performs the following tasks:

1. Calculate the "wind chill index" for the first and last elements of each row, interpreted as temperature and wind speed pairings (assume the first element is the temperature and the last is the wind speed). Use the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Wind Chill Index} = 35.74 + 0.6215 \cdot T - 35.75 \cdot (\text{Speed}^{0.16}) + 0.4275 \cdot T \cdot (\text{Speed}^{0.16})
   \]
   where \(T\) is the temperature in Fahrenheit and Speed is the wind speed in miles per hour.

2. For each calculated wind chill index, round it up to the nearest integer for further processing.

3. Determine the minimum wind chill index value from the calculated rounded values for each row and return it as a list representing the minimum values for each row in the matrix.

This novel question combines elements of numerical computation (wind chill index calculation and rounding), list manipulation, and extracting minimum values, inspired by the given questions on wind chill calculation, rounding numbers, and finding minimum paths.

        # Calculate wind chill index using the given formula
        wind_chill_index = (35.74 + 0.6215 * temperature - 
                            35.75 * (wind_speed ** 0.16) +

        min_wind_chills.append(wind_chill_index_rounded)
        
    return min_wind_chills

```

These tests are designed to cover diverse scenarios, including typical values, large numbers, low temperatures with high wind speeds, and identical elements within rows. Each function works independently of the implementation specifics while allowing us to validate the `calculate_wind_chill_index` function thoroughly.
