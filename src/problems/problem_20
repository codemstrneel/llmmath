QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a string and a list of integers. The function should do the following:

1. Sort the list of tuples in increasing order by the product of the integers in each tuple's list.
2. Identify the tuple with the list whose product of elements is the highest.
3. For the identified tuple, retrieve the last integer from its list, round it up to the nearest integer, and multiply it by the length of the string in the tuple.
4. Return the string associated with that tuple and the final calculated value as a tuple.

This problem requires you to combine list manipulation, string operations, sorting by a computed property, and arithmetic operations.
