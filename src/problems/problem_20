QUESTION

Write a Python function to determine the minimum possible value for a specified cyclic sequence.

SOL & TESTS

To determine the minimum possible value for a specified cyclic sequence, we need to implement a function that takes a sequence as input and returns its minimum rotation in lexicographical order.

### Solution Explanation

Given a sequence (string or list), a cyclic sequence can be obtained by rotating the sequence. For example, for the sequence `[1,2,3,4]`, the cyclic sequences are `[1,2,3,4]`, `[2,3,4,1]`, `[3,4,1,2]`, and `[4,1,2,3]`. The minimum cyclic sequence is the one that is smallest in lexicographical order.

To find the minimum cyclic sequence:
1. Iterate through possible rotations of the sequence.
2. Compare each rotation lexicographically with the currently known minimum sequence.
3. Return the minimum sequence obtained.

### Solution Code
```python
def min_cyclic_sequence(sequence):
    """
    Find the minimum lexicographical rotation of the given cyclic sequence.
    
    :param sequence: List or string to find the minimum cyclic sequence.
    :return: The minimum lexicographical rotation of the sequence.
    """
    n = len(sequence)
    min_rotation = sequence
    for i in range(n):
        rotation = sequence[i:] + sequence[:i]
        if rotation < min_rotation:
            min_rotation = rotation
    return min_rotation
```

    Find the minimum lexicographical rotation of the given cyclic sequence.
    
    :param sequence: List or string to find the minimum cyclic sequence.
    :return: The minimum lexicographical rotation of the sequence.
    """
    n = len(sequence)
    min_rotation = sequence
    for i in range(n):
        rotation = sequence[i:] + sequence[:i]
        if rotation < min_rotation:
            min_rotation = rotation
    return min_rotation
```
