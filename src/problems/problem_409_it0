QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of dictionaries, each containing a "date" key with the value in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, and a target integer. For each dictionary, extract the year, month, and day from the date using regular expressions. Calculate the sum of the year, month, and day, and check if this sum is divisible by the target integer. If divisible, interchange the year and day in the date string within the dictionary. Then, group these modified dictionaries into sublists of length n, discarding any dictionaries that do not fit into complete sublists. Return the list of sublists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve the problem, we will:

1. Parse dates from the list of dictionaries and extract year, month, and day using regular expressions.
2. Sum the year, month, and day.
3. Check if the sum is divisible by the target integer.
4. If divisible, interchange the year and day in the date string.
5. Group the modified dictionaries into sublists of specified length, discarding any incomplete sublists.

Below is the implementation of the solution and corresponding unit tests.
