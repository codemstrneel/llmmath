QUESTION

Create a Python function to determine the minimum value that can be achieved by a given oscillating function over a specified interval.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem of finding the minimum value of an oscillating function over a specified interval, the solution can be implemented by defining a generic function that receives an oscillating function and its defined interval, and evaluates the minimum value over that range.

Let's assume we're dealing with a simple mathematical function like a sine function to illustrate oscillation. However, I'll write the implementation in such a way that it could generalize to other oscillating mathematical functions by passing a function as an argument.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import numpy as np

def solution(func, start, end, num_points=1000):
    """
    Determine the minimum value of a given oscillating function over a specified interval.

    func: The oscillating function to evaluate (e.g., np.sin).
    start: The start of the interval (inclusive).
    end: The end of the interval (exclusive).
    num_points: The number of points to evaluate in the interval. Default is 1000.
    
    Returns:
    The minimum value of the function over the interval.
    """
    x = np.linspace(start, end, num_points)
    y = func(x)
    return np.min(y)
<|Solution End|>
```

The above function `solution` evaluates an oscillating function over a specified interval using a dense set of points (default is 1000) to ensure accuracy. The minimum value is calculated and returned.

Let's create some unit tests for this function:

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution
import numpy as np

def test_minimum_of_sine():
    result = solution(np.sin, 0, 2 * np.pi)
    assert np.isclose(result, -1, atol=1e-5)

def test_minimum_of_cosine():
    result = solution(np.cos, 0, 2 * np.pi)
    assert np.isclose(result, -1, atol=1e-5)

def test_minimum_of_sine_on_zero_interval():
    result = solution(np.sin, 0, 0)
    assert result == 0

def test_minimum_of_sine_small_interval():
    result = solution(np.sin, 0, np.pi / 2)
    assert np.isclose(result, 0, atol=1e-5)

def test_minimum_of_cosine_small_interval():
    result = solution(np.cos, 0, np.pi / 2)
    assert np.isclose(result, 0, atol=1e-5)
<|Test End|>
```

These tests ensure that our solution is properly calculating the minimum value for the `sin` and `cos` functions over different intervals. The tests check for expected values like `-1` occurring in complete spans of cycles of sine and cosine, and `0` on smaller intervals or zero-length intervals. The `np.isclose` function helps in comparing floating point numbers accurately within a small tolerance.
