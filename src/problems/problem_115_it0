QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of tuples and a target integer as its input. Each tuple in the list contains three elements: two integers and a sub-tuple. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each main tuple, use the two integers to:
   - Check if they add up to an odd number using bitwise operators. If they do, continue to the next step; otherwise, skip to the next main tuple.
   - Determine if they can represent the side lengths of a valid triangle. If they cannot form a valid triangle, skip to the next main tuple.

2. From each sub-tuple (which contains several integers), identify all sublists of length three, if present. For each of these sublists:
   - Calculate the area of a rhombus using the first two integers, assuming the diagonals of the rhombus are twice the values of these integers.
   - Check if the third integer equals the target integer, and increment a counter for each occurrence.

3. Return a dictionary with:
   - "valid_rhombus_areas": a list of computed rhombus areas from step 2.
   - "target_count": the total count of how many times the target integer appeared as the third element in each chosen sublist.

Ensure all pairwise elements in the sub-tuple can be used in a manner that considers the constraints described, and assume all integers are positive.
