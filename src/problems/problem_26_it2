QUESTION

Write a Python function to check if a given number can be represented as the sum of the squares of two distinct numbers from a list. If possible, return the pair of numbers. If not, return None.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears there was an issue in the formatting of the solution and tests in the previous attempt, specifically with the syntax of the code blocks. Let me correct this and provide the complete solution and tests again.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(nums, target):
    """
    Given a list of integers and a target integer, checks if the target
    can be represented as the sum of the squares of two distinct numbers
    from the list. If possible, returns the pair of numbers; otherwise, 
    returns None.
    """
    squares = {num ** 2: num for num in nums}
    for num in nums:
        square = num ** 2
        if target - square in squares and squares[target - square] != num:
            return (num, squares[target - square])
    return None
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_pair_exists():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 13) in [(2, 3), (3, 2)]

def test_solution_pair_does_not_exist():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 50) is None

def test_solution_single_element_list():
    assert solution([1], 1) is None

def test_solution_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 1) is None

def test_solution_all_negative_numbers():
    assert solution([-1, -2, -3, -4], 13) is None

def test_solution_target_zero():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2], 0) is None

def test_solution_pair_exists_with_negative_and_positive():
    assert solution([3, -3, 0, 1, 4], 10) in [(1, 3), (3, 1)]

def test_solution_multiple_pairs():
    result = solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 13)
    assert result in [(2, 3), (3, 2)]

def test_solution_no_valid_pair_due_to_duplicates():
    assert solution([5, 3, 4, 3], 25) is None

def test_large_numbers():
    assert solution([10, 15, 20, 25], 625) is None
```
<|Test End|>

These tests cover various edge cases, including handling of negative numbers, duplicates, and scenarios where no valid pair exists. The function is expected to return both possible pairs of numbers that satisfy the condition if they exist, or `None` if no such pair can be formed from the given list.
