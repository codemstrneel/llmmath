QUESTION

Write a Python function to count the number of lists in a given nested list structure, including counting lists within the nested lists themselves. Additionally, ensure that the function can handle and properly count any lists that are part of dictionary values within the nested structure.

SOL & TESTS

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def count_lists(nested_structure):
    """
    Count the number of lists in the nested structure, including lists inside dictionary values.
    
    :param nested_structure: The nested structure to be evaluated. It can be a list, dict, or any other object.
    :return: The count of lists within the nested structure.
    """
    if isinstance(nested_structure, list):
        count = 1  # Count the current list
        for element in nested_structure:
            count += count_lists(element)  # Recursively count lists in each element
        return count
    
    elif isinstance(nested_structure, dict):
        count = 0
        for value in nested_structure.values():
            count += count_lists(value)  # Recursively count lists in each value
        return count
    
    else:
        return 0  # If it's neither a list nor a dict, return 0
