QUESTION

Write a function that processes a list of integers and a list of tuples. The function should:

1. Use a lambda function to filter out numbers from the list of integers that are divisible by at least one of the integers present in any tuple from the list of tuples (ignoring any None values in those tuples).
2. Calculate and return the even parity (True for even, False for odd) of the count of the filtered numbers.

The solution should accommodate lists of differing lengths and handle tuples with None values appropriately.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The solution provided included a syntax error due to incorrect formatting of code blocks. Let me correct that and ensure that the solution and the tests are displayed properly.

Here's the corrected implementation:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(integers, tuples):
    """
    Filters a list of integers based on divisibility by any numbers in tuples
    and returns the parity of the resulting list's count.
    
    Parameters:
    integers (list): List of integers to be filtered.
    tuples (list): List of tuples containing integers and possible None values.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the count of filtered integers is even, False otherwise.
    """
    # Flatten the tuples list and filter out None values
    divisors = {n for t in tuples for n in t if n is not None}

    # Filter integers list: keep elements that are divisible by at least one divisor
    filtered_integers = [x for x in integers if any((d != 0 and x % d == 0) for d in divisors)]
    
    # Determine the parity of the count of filtered integers
    return len(filtered_integers) % 2 == 0
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_none_in_tuple():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [(None, 2), (None, None)]) == False

def test_solution_empty_integers():
    assert solution([], [(1, 2), (3, 4)]) == True

def test_solution_empty_tuples():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], []) == True

def test_solution_mixed_case():
    assert solution([10, 15, 20, 25, 30], [(2, None), (None, 5)]) == False

def test_solution_all_filtered():
    assert solution([2, 4, 6, 8], [(2, 3), (None, 4)]) == True

def test_solution_no_filtered():
    assert solution([9, 11, 13, 17], [(2, 3), (None, 4)]) == True

def test_solution_divisors_with_none():
    assert solution([7, 14, 21, 28], [(None, 2), (None, None)]) == False

def test_solution_single_number():
    assert solution([15], [(3,), (None,)]) == True

def test_solution_single_tuple_empty():
    assert solution([9, 18, 27], [(None, None)]) == True
```

### Explanation:
- The code now uses a set for `divisors` to handle unique divisors extracted from the tuples, filtering out any `None` values.
- Each integer in the list is checked for divisibility by any divisor, filtering those that are divisible.
- The final output checks the parity (even or odd) of the count of numbers that remain after filtering.

The tests have been crafted to verify the function across various edge cases ensuring logical correctness. Each test checks whether the function outputs the correct parity for the remaining integers after filtering.
