QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes three inputs: a list of integers, a target index n, which corresponds to a position in each sublist of a provided list of tuples, and a list of dictionaries. Your function should:

1. Find the maximum value in the nth position across all tuples in the list.
2. Replace the first digit of each integer in the list of integers with the first digit of its factorial, then check if the resulting sequence is strictly increasing.
3. Identify the maximum value obtained from the tuples and use it as a key to sort the list of dictionaries.
4. Return a tuple containing the sorted list of dictionaries, a boolean indicating if the modified integer list is increasing, and a list of indices of tuples where the element in the nth position equals the found maximum.

Use recursion and map functions where appropriate to implement these tasks.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the issues found in the previous solution and tests, we need to make some corrections to ensure that the solution handles edge cases properly and the tests accurately reflect the expected outputs.

### Solution Adjustments:
1. Correctly handle empty `tuples_list` by setting `max_n_value` to a default or error value.
2. Ensure that the integer modification logic correctly handles integers and their factorial.

### Test Adjustments:
1. Fix assertions based on correct expectations.
2. Ensure we're covering edge cases accurately.

Here's the updated solution and tests:

```python

import math

def solution(tuples_list, n, int_list, dict_list):
    def factorial_first_digit(x):
        if x == 0 or x == 1:
            return 1
        fact = math.factorial(x)
        return int(str(fact)[0])
    
    def is_strictly_increasing(lst):
        return all(x < y for x, y in zip(lst, lst[1:]))

    # Step 1: Find the maximum value in the nth position across all tuples in the list
    if not tuples_list:
        return (dict_list, is_strictly_increasing(int_list), [])  # Handling empty case
    max_n_value = max(tup[n] for tup in tuples_list)
    
    # Step 2: Replace the first digit of each integer in the list with the first digit of its factorial then check if it's strictly increasing
    modified_list = list(map(lambda x: int(str(factorial_first_digit(int(str(x)[0]))) + str(x)[1:]), int_list))
    is_increasing = is_strictly_increasing(modified_list)

    # Step 3: Use the maximum value from step 1 as a key to sort the list of dictionaries
    sorted_dicts = sorted(dict_list, key=lambda d: d.get(max_n_value, float('inf')))

    # Step 4: Return the sorted list of dictionaries, whether the modified list is increasing, and list of indices where nth position equals max_n_value
    indices_max_n_value = [i for i, tup in enumerate(tuples_list) if tup[n] == max_n_value]
    return (sorted_dicts, is_increasing, indices_max_n_value)
