QUESTION

Create a Python function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains three elements: a number, a string, and another number. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Find the tuple where the first element is the maximum among all first elements of the tuples.
2. Use a lambda function to filter the tuples where the first or the third element is divisible by a given number \( d \).
3. For the tuples that pass this filter, count the number of vowels in the string element of each tuple.
4. Calculate the standard deviation of the third elements of these filtered tuples.
5. Return a tuple that contains:
   - The tuple with the maximum first element.
   - A list of counts of vowels for each filtered tuple.
   - The standard deviation of the third elements of the filtered tuples.
   
Your function should handle edge cases where the list may be empty, or the tuples may have `None` values. Ensure that the calculations are performed only on valid tuples.
