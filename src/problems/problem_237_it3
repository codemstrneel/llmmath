QUESTION

Original Question: Write a Python function to left rotate the bits of a given number.

New Question: Write a Python function to left rotate the bits of a given number by a specified number of positions, and ensure it works correctly for both positive and negative integers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The compilation error due to invalid syntax indicates there might have been an inadvertent inclusion of incorrect syntax or format in my response. Let's properly structure the solution and test cases without extraneous syntactic mistakes.

Re-evaluate the implementation, remove unnecessary formatting issues, and correctly implement the solution with an effective test suite.

The task is to perform a left bit rotation and to handle this operation correctly for a specified number of bits. Let's correct and test the solution again.

Here is a revised version of the solution and the tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(number, bits, width=32):
    """
    Left rotates the bits of the given number by the specified number of positions.

    :param number: The integer whose bits are to be rotated, can be positive or negative.
    :param bits: The number of bit positions to rotate to the left.
    :param width: The bit width to consider for the rotation operation.
    :return: The integer result of left rotating the bits of the input number.
    """
    # Normalize the number of rotations to stay within the bit width
    bits = bits % width
    
    # Create a two's complement value for negative numbers
    if number < 0:
        number += (1 << width)

    # Perform the rotation
    rotated_number = ((number << bits) | (number >> (width - bits))) & ((1 << width) - 1)
    
    # Convert back to signed integer if necessary
    if rotated_number & (1 << (width - 1)):
        rotated_number -= (1 << width)
    
    return rotated_number
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_positive_number():
    assert solution(28, 2) == 112  # 28 is 0001 1100, rotating by 2 gives 0111 0000 which is 112
    assert solution(5, 1) == 10    # 5 is 0101, rotating by 1 gives 1010 which is 10

def test_solution_large_rotation():
    assert solution(9, 8) == 9  # rotating by 8 on 0000 1001 gives the same 1001 which is 9
    assert solution(1, 32) == 1  # rotating full cycle on 0001 remains 0001

def test_solution_negative_number():
    # Assuming 32-bit width, -2 is represented in binary as: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111110
    # Rotate left by 1: becomes 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111101 which is -3 in two's complement
    assert solution(-2, 1) == -3

    # -8 is represented as: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000
    # Rotate left by 2: becomes 11111111 11111111 11111111 11100011 which is -29
    assert solution(-8, 2) == -29

def test_solution_zero():
    assert solution(0, 2) == 0  # Zero remains unchanged after any rotation

def test_solution_rotation_amount():
    n = 57
    assert solution(n, 32) == n  # Rotation by a full width results in the same number
    assert solution(n, 64) == n  # Rotation by a multiple of full width should result in the same number
```
<|Test End|>

This version addresses the previous formatting issues and produces a clear, comprehensible solution with corrected test cases. The tests are structured to check typical cases, extreme bit rotations, zero input, and both positive and negative integers, ensuring complete coverage of functionality.
