QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a string and a number representing precision as input and performs two tasks: first, find and return the length of the last word in the string, and second, determine if this length can be adjusted by rounding up to the nearest value given by the precision. If it can be, return the rounded length; otherwise, return the original length.
