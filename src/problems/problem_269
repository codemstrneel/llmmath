QUESTION

Create a function that processes a given text in the following ways:

1. Identify all sequences of consecutive uppercase characters and store each sequence with its starting and ending index.
2. Extract all numbers present in the text using regular expressions and store them as integers in a list.
3. Remove duplicate numbers while preserving their original order using the `collections` module.
4. For each sequence of uppercase characters found, check if the sum of the distinct numbers equals or exceeds the length of the sequence. If it does, append the starting and ending index of that sequence to a result list.
5. Return the list of indices of those sequences whose length condition is met.

This question combines elements of finding uppercase sequences (related to Questions 1 and 5), working with numbers using regular expressions (related to Questions 2 and 5), and manipulating data using the `collections` module to handle duplicates (related to Question 3).

SOL & TESTS

```python
import re
from collections import OrderedDict

def process_text(text):
    """
    Processes the given text to find sequences of uppercase characters and numbers.
    
    Performs the following operations:
    1. Identify all sequences of consecutive uppercase characters and store each sequence with its starting and ending index.
    2. Extract all numbers from the text and store unique numbers in a list while preserving their order.
    3. For each sequence of uppercase characters found, check if the sum of the distinct numbers equals or exceeds 
       the length of the sequence. If it does, append the starting and ending index of that sequence to a result list.
    4. Return the list of indices whose condition is met.
    
    Args:
    text (str): The input text to process.
    
    Returns:
    list of tuple: A list of tuples containing the starting and ending indices of uppercase sequences meeting the condition.
    """
    
    # Find all sequences of consecutive uppercase characters with their indices
    uppercase_sequences = [(match.start(), match.end() - 1) for match in re.finditer(r'[A-Z]+', text)]
    
    # Extract all numbers from the text and make them unique while preserving the order
    numbers = [int(x) for x in re.findall(r'\d+', text)]
    unique_numbers = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(numbers))
    
    # Calculate the sum of the unique numbers
    sum_of_numbers = sum(unique_numbers)
    
    # Find all indices of sequences meeting the length condition
    result = []

        if sum_of_numbers >= (end - start + 1):
            result.append((start, end))
