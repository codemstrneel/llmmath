QUESTION

Create a function that processes a list of strings and numbers, performing the following tasks:

1. Use regular expressions to filter out strings that start with a vowel followed by one or more consonants (e.g., "owl", "in").
2. For each filtered string, convert it from camelCase to kebab-case.
3. Calculate the nth nonagonal number for each numeric element in the list.
4. Return a tuple containing three elements:
   - A list of processed strings (converted to kebab-case).
   - A dictionary mapping each original string (before conversion) in the filtered list to the count of each distinct character within them.
   - A list of nonagonal numbers corresponding to each number in the original list.

This new question integrates regex pattern matching, camelCase to kebab-case conversion, character counting, and nonagonal number calculation, drawing on concepts from the provided set of questions.

SOL & TESTS

```python
import re

def process_items(items):
    def is_vowel_consonant(s):
        return bool(re.match(r'^[aeiou][bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]+', s, re.IGNORECASE))

    def camel_to_kebab(s):
        return ''.join(['-' + c.lower() if c.isupper() else c for c in s]).lstrip('-')

    def nonagonal_number(n):
        return n * (7 * n - 5) // 2

    # Step 1: Filter strings that start with a vowel followed by consonants
    filtered_strings = [item for item in items if isinstance(item, str) and is_vowel_consonant(item)]
    
    # Step 2: Convert filtered strings from camelCase to kebab-case
    kebab_strings = [camel_to_kebab(s) for s in filtered_strings]
    
    # Step 3: Calculate character count for each original filtered string
    char_count_dict = {s: {char: s.lower().count(char) for char in set(s.lower())} for s in filtered_strings}
    
    # Step 4: Calculate nonagonal numbers for numeric elements in the list
    nonagonal_numbers = [nonagonal_number(n) for n in items if isinstance(n, int)]

    return kebab_strings, char_count_dict, nonagonal_numbers
