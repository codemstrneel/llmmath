QUESTION

Write a function that takes two integer parameters \( l \) and \( r \), a list of lists where each sublist contains integers, and a tuple of three integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each sublist, calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. Sum all these differences together.
2. If this sum falls within the inclusive range defined by the first two integers of the tuple, round this sum up to the nearest multiple of the third integer from the tuple.
3. Within the integer range defined by \( l \) and \( r \), check for each integer if it can be one angle of a valid triangle with the other two angles chosen from the tuple, where the sum of any two angles must be greater than the third angle.
4. Return a dictionary with two key-value pairs:
   - "adjusted_sum": the rounded sum from step 2.
   - "triangle_count": the count of integers within the range \( l \) and \( r \) that can be one angle of a valid triangle with the other two angles selected from the tuple.
