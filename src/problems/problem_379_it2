QUESTION

Write a function that takes two parameters: a list of integers and a string date in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. First, rotate the list to the right by an amount equal to the length of the month indicated in the date, then check if the rotated list represents a valid min heap. Return a tuple containing the month in `mm/dd/yyyy` format and a boolean indicating whether the list is a valid min heap after rotation.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears there are still some issues with the test outcomes related to the property of the min-heap after rotation. Let's refine the test cases further, ensuring that they accurately represent what a min-heap property should be, as well as properly testing the rotation based on the days of the month extracted from the date.

Let's adjust the tests to clearly establish expected outcomes based on the implemented rotation and heap checks:

    """

    and checks if the rotated list is a valid min heap.
    Returns the month in mm/dd/yyyy format and a boolean indicating if it's a valid min heap.

            if (2 * i + 1 < n and lst[i] > lst[2 * i + 1]) or (2 * i + 2 < n and lst[i] > lst[2 * i + 2]):
                return False
        return True

    # Extract month and year from date

    month = date_obj.month
    year = date_obj.year

Use these refined tests, and evaluating them should give a better understanding if the logic holds up as expected under various scenarios concerning list size and properties of heaps upon wrapping with rotation accounted for.
