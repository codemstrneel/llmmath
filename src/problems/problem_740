QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and a list of strings as input and performs the following operations:

1. **Odd Parity Filtering and Sorting:**
   - Use a lambda function to filter only the integers with odd parity from the list of integers.
   - Sort these odd-parity integers in ascending order without using any traditional sorting algorithms. Assume the integers can only be 0, 1, or 2, and sort accordingly.

2. **Duplicate and Custom Word Sorting:**
   - In the list of strings, remove duplicate words from each individual string.
   - Move strings containing the word "odd" to the end of the list.
   - Sort the modified strings based on their length in descending order.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - Construct a resultant list of strings from step 2.
   - Append a string describing the sum of the odd-parity integers at the end of this list. The string should be formatted to show each integer and the sum calculated.

This novel question requires combining concepts like odd parity checking, filtering with lambda, list manipulation, and formatted string outputting to handle different data types coherently.

SOL & TESTS

```python
def process_lists(int_list, str_list):
    """
    Processes two lists according to specified operations on integers and strings.
    
    Parameters:
    - int_list (list of int): A list of integers.
    - str_list (list of str): A list of strings.
    
    Returns:
    - List of strings where the first part consists of processed strings and the last part 
      is a formatted string showing the odd-parity integers and their sum.

    # Step 1: Odd Parity Filtering and Sorting
    # Filter only odd-valued integers (1 in this specific range)
    odd_parity = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 1, int_list))
    
    # Since integers are only 0, 1, or 2, sorting is trivial
    sorted_odds = sorted(odd_parity)  # or simply list(odd_parity), as we only sort 1s in this context

    # Step 2: Duplicate and Custom Word Sorting
    processed_strings = []
    for string in str_list:
        # Remove duplicate words
        words = string.split()
