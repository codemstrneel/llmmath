QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a URL containing a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` and an integer `n`. The function performs the following steps:

1. Use regex to extract the year, month, and day from the URL.
2. Consider these extracted values as a sequence of integers `[year, month, day]`.
3. Write a quadratic equation using these values as coefficients, where \( a \) is the year, \( b \) is the month, and \( c \) is the day.
4. Determine if the roots of the quadratic equation are integers.
5. If the roots are integers, use the indices of the roots (as rounded down integers) to split the list from `[1, 2, ..., n]` into three segments.
6. Reverse each segment of the list.
7. Concatenate these three reversed segments back together.
8. If the roots are not integer, return the list from `[1, 2, ..., n]` unchanged.

### Example:

For the URL `"https://example.com/date/2000-04-02/info"` and `n=10`, the quadratic is \(2000x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0\). If the roots are integers and for instance are 1.414 and 2.828, you use 1 and 2 (rounded down) as indices to split and reverse. The list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` will become `[1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

For the URL `"https://example.com/date/1900-01-01/info"` and `n=5`, the quadratic is \(1900x^2 + 1x + 1 = 0\). If the roots are not integers, the list remains `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Constraints:

1. The URL always contains a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. Assume n will be no greater than 1000.
3. Consider the roots' indices after rounding down, for both roots if they are integers.
4. The list consists of integers from 1 to `n`.

```python

    """
    Processes a URL with a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD and performs
    operations as described above based on integer roots of a quadratic equation.

    match = re.search(r'(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})', url)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("URL does not contain a valid date.")
    
    year, month, day = map(int, match.groups())

    a, b, c = year, month, day
    
    # Calculate discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    
    # If discriminant is negative, there are no real roots
    if discriminant < 0:

    # Calculate the roots
    sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    root1 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * a)
    root2 = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * a)
    
    # Check if roots are integers
    if root1.is_integer() and root2.is_integer():
        root1, root2 = int(root1), int(root2)
        split_idxs = sorted([root1, root2])

        sequence = list(range(1, n + 1))
        try:
            segment1 = sequence[:split_idxs[0]]
            segment2 = sequence[split_idxs[0]:split_idxs[1]]
            segment3 = sequence[split_idxs[1]:]

            return segment1[::-1] + segment2[::-1] + segment3[::-1]
        
        except IndexError:
            # If any index goes out of bounds, return the original list
            return sequence
        
    else:

        return list(range(1, n + 1))

These unit tests ensure that the function works under several scenarios, including URLs with integer and non-integer roots, different list lengths, and invalid URL formats.
