QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a string containing integers (possibly interspersed with parentheses) and performs the following operations:

1. **Extract and Clean:** Extract all integer numbers from the string, ignoring any integer sequences within parentheses.
2. **Convert and Sort:** Convert the extracted integers from the string into a tuple and sort them in ascending order.
3. **Subarray Product Calculation:** Determine all possible subarrays of this sorted tuple. For each subarray, calculate the product of its elements.
4. **Chunk and Analyze Products:** Collect the products of all subarrays into a list and then split this list into chunks of size `n`, where `n` is an additional parameter provided to the function.
5. **Frequency Analysis:** Return the list of chunked products as well as a dictionary that counts how many times each product appears across all subarrays (excluding any subarrays derived from ignored figures within parentheses).

This exercise combines concepts of string manipulation (ignoring specific segments), type conversion, tuple sorting, subarray product calculation, data chunking, and frequency analysis.

from collections import Counter

def process_string_and_calculate_products(s, n):
    """
    Processes the string to perform the specified operations: extract, sort, calculate products,
    and perform frequency analysis.

    :param s: A string containing integers and potentially parentheses.
    :param n: The chunk size for the list of products.
    :return: A tuple consisting of the chunked list of products and a frequency dictionary of products.
    """
    # Remove content within parentheses
    s_cleaned = re.sub(r'\(.*?\)', '', s)
    
    # Extract integers
    numbers = list(map(int, re.findall(r'-?\d+', s_cleaned)))
    
    # Sort integers
    sorted_numbers = tuple(sorted(numbers))
    
    # Generate all subarrays
    subarrays = (sorted_numbers[i:j] for i in range(len(sorted_numbers)) for j in range(i + 1, len(sorted_numbers) + 1))
    
    # Calculate products of all subarrays
    products = [1 if not subarray else eval('*'.join(map(str, subarray))) for subarray in subarrays]
    
    # Split products into chunks of size n
    chunked_products = [products[i:i + n] for i in range(0, len(products), n)]
    
    # Calculate frequency of products
    frequency = Counter(products)
    
    return chunked_products, frequency
