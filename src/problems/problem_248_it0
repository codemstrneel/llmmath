QUESTION

Write a function to calculate the number of ways to make a target sum using a set of given integers, where each integer can be used an unlimited number of times.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Here is the solution using a dynamic programming approach along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(target, nums):
    """
    Calculate the number of ways to form the target sum using given integers with unlimited repetitions allowed.
    
    Parameters:
    target (int): The target sum to be formed.
    nums (List[int]): List of integers that can be used to form the target sum.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of ways to form the target sum.
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the number of ways to make each sum up to target
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case: there's one way to make the sum 0, which is to use no numbers
    
    for num in nums:
        for i in range(num, target + 1):
            dp[i] += dp[i - num]
    
    return dp[target]
