QUESTION

Write a function to find the sequences of one or more uppercase letters followed by at least two lowercase letters, and ensure the entire sequence is a palindrome when reversed.

SOL & TESTS

```python
def find_palindrome_sequences(s):
    import re
    found_sequences = []
    # Pattern to find sequences of one or more uppercase letters followed by two or more lowercase
    pattern = r'[A-Z]+[a-z]{2,}'
    matches = re.finditer(pattern, s)
    for match in matches:
        sequence = match.group()
        if sequence == sequence[::-1]:  # Check if the sequence is a palindrome
            found_sequences.append(sequence)
    return found_sequences
```
