QUESTION

**Question 7:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and a string representing a target character ("digit", "alpha", or "special") and performs an array transformation and evaluation through the following stages:

1. **Array Transformation Stage:** For each integer in the list, generate a string by repeating the character with ASCII code equal to the integer value, repeated a number of times equal to the sum of the digits of the integer.

2. **String Transformation Stage:** For each generated string, shift the characters cyclically to the right by a number of places equivalent to the integerâ€™s index in the initial list.

3. **Character Evaluation Stage:** Determine the dominant character type ("digit", "alpha", or "special character") in each transformed string by evaluating the number of occurrences of each character type.

4. **Character Matching Stage:** Based on the target character type, retain only those integers whose transformed strings have the same dominant character type as the target.

5. **Harmonic Adjustment Stage:** Compute the harmonic sum for each retained integer's position index in the list and append it to the integer.

6. **Output Construction:** Return a dictionary where each key corresponds to the integer's index in the original list, and the value is a tuple containing the retained integer and its harmonic sum.

Examples:
- For the list `[65, 97, 35, 52]` and target "alpha", the function processes to provide a dictionary with entries corresponding to final retained integers.
- Given `[33, 124, 48]` and target "digit", use the stages to determine the resulting dictionary based on the rules.

This problem combines concepts of digit manipulation, character type evaluation, cyclic transformation, and harmonic computations in a novel way.
