QUESTION

Create a Python function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist represents a sequence of integer values. The aim is to find the maximum possible value for each sublist using a periodic function, and convert each resulting value into a tuple of digits. Return a list of these tuples, where each tuple represents the maximum periodic-derived digit sequence from the corresponding sublist.

To clarify, the task involves applying concepts from finding extreme values of functions, extracting elements from sublists, and converting numbers to digit sequences, combined into a new multi-step problem.

SOL & TESTS

## Solution

To solve the problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify a Periodic Transformation**: While the problem mentions a periodic function, it doesn't specify the function. For simplicity, let's assume we're dealing with the trigonometric function \( \sin(x) \), normalized between 0 and 1 for integer sequence transformations.
   
2. **Find Maximum Value for Each Sublist**: We apply this transformation to each integer and seek the sublist entry that results in the maximum periodic-transformed value.

3. **Convert to a Tuple of Digits**: For the maximum transformed value in each sublist, convert the integer value (from the sublist) to a tuple of its digits.

4. **Return the List of Tuples**: For each sublist, generate the corresponding tuple of digits, and return a list of these tuples.

Here's the solution:

```python
import math

def max_periodic_tuples(list_of_lists):
    """
    Given a list of lists where each sublist contains integer values,
    find the maximum value derived using a periodic function (sin in this case)
    from each sublist, convert these to a tuple of digits, and return them as a list.
    """
    def convert_to_tuple_of_digits(number):
        return tuple(int(digit) for digit in str(number))
    
    result = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Apply the sin to each element, normalize it to [0, 1], and find the max
        max_val = max(sublist, key=lambda x: math.sin(x) + 1)
        # Convert the max value to a tuple of its digits
        max_tuple = convert_to_tuple_of_digits(max_val)
        result.append(max_tuple)
    
    return result
```

## Test

We'll create unit tests to validate the solution works as expected.

```python
from solution import max_periodic_tuples

def test_single_sublist():
    assert max_periodic_tuples([[2, 3, 4]]) == [(4,)]
    
def test_multiple_sublists():
    assert max_periodic_tuples([[0, 90, 180], [45, 135, 225]]) == [(0,), (4, 5,)]
    
def test_empty_sublists():
    assert max_periodic_tuples([[], []]) == [(), ()]
    
def test_negative_and_positive():
    assert max_periodic_tuples([[-1, 1], [-2, 2], [0, -90, 90]]) == [(1,), (2,), (0,)]
    
def test_large_numbers():
    assert max_periodic_tuples([[999, 1000, 1234]]) == [(1, 2, 3, 4)]

def test_repeated_numbers():
    assert max_periodic_tuples([[3, 3, 3], [6, 6, 6]]) == [(3,), (6,)]
``` 

In these tests, we've included cases to cover typical behavior, edge cases like empty sublists, handling of negative and positive numbers, large numbers, and repeated numbers.
