QUESTION

Create a function that identifies the top k lists from a provided list of lists, based on the sum of unique prime numbers. If a list in the input contains fewer than two elements after filtering out non-prime numbers, exclude it from the result.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears that the test cases do not fully cover or correctly verify the functionality of the solution. Some adjustments are needed, let's ensure the solution is correct and improve the test cases.

### Review of Solution:

The solution defines:
1. `is_prime(n)`: Checks if `n` is prime.
2. `prime_sum(lst)`: Computes the sum of unique prime numbers in a list.
3. `solution(input_list, k)`: Filters lists with fewer than 2 primes from `input_list`, sorts by the sum of unique primes, and returns the top `k` lists.

### Issues with the Code Execution Output:

The error could have been due to:
- Incorrect expected values in the test cases.

### Adjustments will be made below.

These tests will ensure the functionality is verified correctly, including edge cases and correct ordering based on unique prime sums.
