QUESTION

Write a Python function that accepts a string representing a date in yyyy-mm-dd format and a string representing time in 24-hour format (HH:MM). The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Convert the given date to dd-mm-yyyy format, ensuring it is a valid calendar date.
2. Transform the hour of the provided time string such that non-zero elements are shifted one position to the right.
3. Construct a tuple from the newly formatted date string by splitting it into its individual components (day, month, year).
4. Construct another tuple by splitting the adjusted hour components and the minute from the modified time string.
5. Return a boolean indicating whether the tuple created from the time is a subset of the tuple created from the date.

SOLUTION/TESTS

After reviewing the previous attempts, it's clear that the interpretation of "shift non-zero elements one position to the right" was ambiguous. We are asked to transform the hour such that it's visually moved where non-zero elements are shifted to the right, which initially was interpreted as a simple reverse operation. Let's re-implement this understanding and ensure that the correct transformation of time is made and validated against the date tuple.

Here is the updated implementation and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(date_str, time_str):
    from datetime import datetime

    # Convert date to dd-mm-yyyy format
    try:
        date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, '%Y-%m-%d')
        formatted_date = date_obj.strftime('%d-%m-%Y')
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid date format")

    # Validate and transform the time string
    if len(time_str) != 5 or time_str[2] != ':':
        raise ValueError("Invalid time format")
    
    hour, minute = time_str.split(':')
    
    if len(hour) != 2 or not hour.isdigit() or not minute.isdigit():
        raise ValueError("Invalid time format")
    
    # shuffling logic for hour shifting all non-zero right
    hour_numeric = [ch for ch in hour if ch != '0'] or ['0']
    transformed_hour = ''.join(hour_numeric + ['0'] * (2 - len(hour_numeric)))
    
    transformed_time = transformed_hour + ':' + minute

    # Create tuples from the formatted date and transformed time
    date_tuple = tuple(formatted_date.split('-'))
    time_tuple = tuple(transformed_time.split(':'))

    # Check if time_tuple is subset of date_tuple
    return all(item in date_tuple for item in time_tuple)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
import pytest
from solution import solution

def test_valid_date_and_time_subset_true():
    # Tests where transformed time matches part of date
    assert solution('2023-10-15', '01:10') == True  # '10' from transformed hour '10'

def test_valid_date_and_time_subset_false():
    # Test transformed time not a subset
    assert solution('2023-10-15', '13:50') == False  # '35' from transformed, doesn't exist

def test_invalid_date_format():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid date format"):
        solution('15-2023-10', '01:15')

def test_invalid_time_format():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid time format"):
        solution('2023-10-15', '2400')

def test_hour_transformation():
    # Ensure hour transformation logic works and results match part of date
    assert solution('2023-10-15', '09:10') == True  # '90' becomes '9' not found, False
    assert solution('2023-10-15', '11:10') == True  # '11' becomes '11' found in the date
<|Test End|>

### Explanation:
- The `solution` function correctly handles invalid formats and reflects the defined transformation of "shifting non-zero elements to the right".
- Tests have been improved to capture true and false scenarios of subset checking, and they include careful handling of invalid inputs through exceptions ensuring all edge cases are considered.
