QUESTION

Write a function that takes in a binary tree and returns the sum of the Fibonacci numbers corresponding to the heights of all its leaf nodes. Calculate the Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The errors in the previous attempts stemmed from incorrect syntax and misinterpretation of Fibonacci calculations. I will correct these errors by ensuring proper syntax and verifying correct expectations for the Fibonacci calculations. Let's go through the solution and the fixed tests.

### Revised Solution Explanation

In the solution provided, we need to:

1. Define the `TreeNode` class for constructing the binary tree.
2. Implement a recursive `fibonacci` function to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
3. Use a `helper` function within `sum_fibonacci_of_leaf_heights` to traverse the tree, calculate the height of each leaf, and accumulate the Fibonacci of their heights.

Here's the corrected code:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

def sum_fibonacci_of_leaf_heights(root):
    if not root:
        return 0

    def helper(node, current_height):
        if not node:
            return 0
        if not node.left and not node.right:  # Leaf node
            return fibonacci(current_height)
        return helper(node.left, current_height + 1) + helper(node.right, current_height + 1)

    return helper(root, 0)
```
<|Solution End|>

### Revised Unit Tests

The test cases need to accurately reflect the outcomes of the function as per Fibonacci sequence calculations:

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import TreeNode, sum_fibonacci_of_leaf_heights

def test_single_node():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    assert sum_fibonacci_of_leaf_heights(root) == 0  # Height is 0, Fibonacci(0) = 0

def test_two_level_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3))
    assert sum_fibonacci_of_leaf_heights(root) == 2  # Leaves at height 1, Fibonacci(1) = 1, 1+1=2

def test_three_level_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    root.left = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5))
    root.right = TreeNode(3)
    assert sum_fibonacci_of_leaf_heights(root) == 3  # Leaves at height 2, Fibonacci(2) = 1, 1+1=2, 2+1=3 (2 leaves)

def test_unbalanced_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    root.left = TreeNode(2)
    root.left.left = TreeNode(3)  # Only one leaf at height 2
    root.right = TreeNode(4)
    assert sum_fibonacci_of_leaf_heights(root) == 2  # Leaves at height 2, Fibonacci(2) = 1, 1+1=2

def test_empty_tree():
    root = None
    assert sum_fibonacci_of_leaf_heights(root) == 0  # No tree, no leaves

def test_full_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    root.left = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5))
    root.right = TreeNode(3, TreeNode(6), TreeNode(7))
    assert sum_fibonacci_of_leaf_heights(root) == 4  # Leaves at height 2, Fibonacci(2) = 1, 1+1=2 for each leaf
```
<|Test End|>

These tests correctly reflect the Fibonacci function's calculations and cover a variety of tree structures to ensure robust testing of the solution.
