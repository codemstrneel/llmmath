QUESTION

Create a Python function that processes a list of strings and performs the following operations:

1. For each string in the list, split it at each uppercase letter and create a list of the resulting segments.
2. Check if each segment contains identical characters (e.g., "aaa" or "ZZ").
3. Sum the lengths of all such segments that consist solely of identical characters.
4. Add the minimum number to this sum such that the total becomes even.

Your function should return the processed list of segments alongside the calculated even total for the sum of identical-character segments.

```python
def process_string_list(strings):
    """
    Process a list of strings by splitting each string at uppercase letters, 
    checking for segments with identical characters, and calculating an even total sum
    of lengths of such segments.
    
    Args:
    strings (list of str): List of strings to process
    
    Returns:
    tuple: 
        - list of lists of str: Each sublist contains segments of a string split by uppercase letters
        - int: Even total of lengths of segments with identical characters
    """
    import re

    segments_list = []
    sum_of_identicals = 0

    for s in strings:
        # Split string at uppercase letters
        segments = re.split(r'(?=[A-Z])', s)
        segments_list.append(segments)

        # Check each segment for identical characters
        for segment in segments:
            if len(segment) > 0 and all(c == segment[0] for c in segment):
                sum_of_identicals += len(segment)

    # Ensure the sum is even by adding 1 if it's odd
    even_total = sum_of_identicals if sum_of_identicals % 2 == 0 else sum_of_identicals + 1
    
    return segments_list, even_total
