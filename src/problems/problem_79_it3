QUESTION

Write a function to rotate a given list by a specified number of items to the left direction.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address and reformulate the solution and the unit tests while ensuring the syntax aligns with Python's execution context. We'll ensure the solution is correctly formatted and tests are comprehensive. 

The error noted in the past attempts was due to the inclusion of markdown-style code block delimiters, which are unnecessary within the executable environment.

Here's the corrected version of the solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(lst, n):
    """
    Rotates the list lst to the left by n items.
    """
    if not lst:
        return lst
    n = n % len(lst)  # Handle cases where n is greater than list length
    return lst[n:] + lst[:n]
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_rotation_normal():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

def test_solution_rotation_no_change():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_solution_rotation_full_circle():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_solution_rotation_single_element():
    assert solution([1], 3) == [1]

def test_solution_rotation_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 3) == []

def test_solution_rotation_more_than_length():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 4) == [2, 3, 1]

def test_solution_rotation_negative_rotation():
    # Negative rotations to the left are equivalent to positive rotations to the right
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -1) == [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -6) == [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]  # -6 is equivalent to rotating -1
<|Test End|>

This code removes unnecessary delimiters and should execute without syntax errors. The tests are designed to cover various edge cases, ensuring the solution operates correctly for diverse inputs.
