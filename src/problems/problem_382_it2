QUESTION

Write a Python function that accepts a string representing a date in yyyy-mm-dd format and a string representing time in 24-hour format (HH:MM). The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Convert the given date to dd-mm-yyyy format, ensuring it is a valid calendar date.
2. Transform the hour of the provided time string such that non-zero elements are shifted one position to the right.
3. Construct a tuple from the newly formatted date string by splitting it into its individual components (day, month, year).
4. Construct another tuple by splitting the adjusted hour components and the minute from the modified time string.
5. Return a boolean indicating whether the tuple created from the time is a subset of the tuple created from the date.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The errors with the test cases stem from incorrect handling of invalid time formats and the logic around transforming the hour in such a way that "Shift non-zero elements one position to the right" meant reversing the digits, which was not clear. We'll approach it by reinterpreting the transformation logic in a more meaningful way and addressing exceptions accurately.

Let's focus on a clear transformation logic for the time and a better strategy for handling cases when the length of `time_str` is unexpected.

### Key Points:
1. Transformation means shifting digits of the hour such that each digit pair is reversed.
2. We will ensure both date and time formats are strictly validated.
3. Tests will be clear and implementation-independent.

Let's adjust the solution and the test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(date_str, time_str):
    from datetime import datetime

    # Convert date to dd-mm-yyyy format
    try:
        date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, '%Y-%m-%d')
        formatted_date = date_obj.strftime('%d-%m-%Y')
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid date format")

    # Validate and transform time: Reverse digits in hour
    if len(time_str) != 5 or time_str[2] != ':':
        raise ValueError("Invalid time format")
    
    hour, minute = time_str.split(':')
    
    if len(hour) != 2 or not hour.isdigit() or not minute.isdigit():
        raise ValueError("Invalid time format")
    
    transformed_hour = hour[::-1]  # Reverse the hour digits
    transformed_time = transformed_hour + ':' + minute

    # Create tuples from the formatted date and transformed time
    date_tuple = tuple(formatted_date.split('-'))
    time_tuple = tuple(transformed_time.split(':'))

    # Check if time_tuple is subset of date_tuple
    return all(item in date_tuple for item in time_tuple)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
import pytest
from solution import solution

def test_valid_date_and_time_subset_true():
    # Test with a time that, when transformed, matches part of the date
    assert solution('2023-10-15', '03:15') == True  # because '30' is a potential reorder

def test_valid_date_and_time_subset_false():
    # Test transformed time not a subset
    assert solution('2023-10-15', '14:50') == False  # '41:50' doesn't match in date

def test_invalid_date_format():
    # Test with invalid date format
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid date format"):
        solution('15-2023-10', '01:15')

def test_invalid_time_format():
    # Test with invalid time string
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid time format"):
        solution('2023-10-15', '2400')

def test_hour_transformation():
    # Test to ensure reverse for '23' becomes '32'
    assert solution('2023-10-15', '23:32') == True  # '32' in year

    # Test the time transformation logic with unconventional, boundary times
    assert solution('2023-10-15', '21:00') == True  # '12' in month
    assert solution('2023-10-15', '00:00') == True  # '00' in month and year
<|Test End|>

### Explanation
- The `solution` has been updated to ensure only correct time formats are processed and digits in the hour are reversed.
- Tests verify both valid and invalid scenarios with `pytest.raises` for error handling.
- This design ensures implementation independence, strictly focusing on specifications.
