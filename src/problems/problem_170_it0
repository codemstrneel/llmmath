QUESTION

Write a function to find two elements from two sorted arrays such that their sum is closest to a given target value.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve the problem of finding two elements from two sorted arrays such that their sum is closest to a given target value, we can use a two-pointer approach. One pointer will start at the beginning of the first array, and the other pointer will start at the end of the second array. By systematically adjusting the pointers based on the sum comparison with the target, we can efficiently find the pair that has a sum closest to the target. Here's how we can implement this:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(arr1, arr2, target):
    """
    Find two elements from two sorted arrays such that their sum is closest to the target value.
    :param arr1: List[int] - Sorted list of integers.
    :param arr2: List[int] - Sorted list of integers.
    :param target: int - Target sum value
    :return: Tuple[int, int] - Elements from arr1 and arr2 whose sum is closest to target.
    """
    i, j = 0, len(arr2) - 1
    closest_pair = (arr1[0], arr2[0])
    closest_diff = float('inf')

    while i < len(arr1) and j >= 0:
        current_sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j]
        current_diff = abs(current_sum - target)
        
        if current_diff < closest_diff:
            closest_diff = current_diff
            closest_pair = (arr1[i], arr2[j])
        
        if current_sum < target:
            i += 1
        else:
            j -= 1
            
    return closest_pair
```
<|Solution End|>

The above solution uses a two-pointer technique to traverse the two sorted arrays. It tracks the closest pair (in terms of their sum being near the target) by comparing each potential pair during traversal.

Now, let's write some unit tests to verify the correctness of this solution:

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_general_case():
    arr1 = [1, 4, 5]
    arr2 = [2, 3, 6]
    target = 8
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    possible_solutions = [(5, 3), (4, 4)]
    assert result in possible_solutions
    
def test_single_element_arrays():
    arr1 = [2]
    arr2 = [3]
    target = 5
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    assert result == (2, 3)
    
def test_negative_numbers():
    arr1 = [-5, -3, 0, 3, 5]
    arr2 = [-10, -2, 1, 6, 8]
    target = 1
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    assert result == (3, -2) or result == (0, 1)
    
def test_zeros_in_arrays():
    arr1 = [0, 2, 4]
    arr2 = [-3, 0, 3]
    target = 1
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    assert result == (0, 3)

def test_identical_elements():
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
    arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
    target = 5
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    possible_solutions = [(2, 3), (3, 2)]
    assert result in possible_solutions
```
<|Test End|>

These unit tests cover various scenarios, including arrays with negative numbers, zeros, same elements, and the case when arrays have a single element. This will ensure that our solution correctly handles different types of input arrays.
