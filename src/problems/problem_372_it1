QUESTION

Write a function that checks if an array represents a min heap, and if it does, converts each element to a formatted string representing the sum of each element with its index in "HH:MM" format. If the array does not represent a min heap, return an empty list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the invalid syntax issue, I will ensure the removal of extra triple backticks in your code snippets as per your expected output format. Here is the corrected solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def is_min_heap(arr):
    """
    Checks if the given array represents a min heap.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range((n - 2) // 2 + 1):
        if (2 * i + 1 < n and arr[i] > arr[2 * i + 1]) or (2 * i + 2 < n and arr[i] > arr[2 * i + 2]):
            return False
    return True

def format_to_time(value):
    """
    Formats a given integer value into "HH:MM" format.
    """
    hours = value // 60
    minutes = value % 60
    return f"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}"

def solution(arr):
    """
    Checks if the array represents a min heap. If it does,
    returns an array where each element is transformed into
    a "HH:MM" format string representing the sum of the element
    with its index. If it does not, returns an empty list.
    """
    if not is_min_heap(arr):
        return []
    
    return [format_to_time(value + index) for index, value in enumerate(arr)]
```
<|Solution End|>
<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_min_heap_conversion():
    arr = [10, 15, 20, 17, 25]
    assert solution(arr) == ['00:10', '00:16', '00:22', '00:20', '00:29']

def test_non_heap_returns_empty():
    arr = [20, 15, 10, 5, 25]
    assert solution(arr) == []

def test_single_element_heap():
    arr = [5]
    assert solution(arr) == ['00:05']

def test_empty_array():
    arr = []
    assert solution(arr) == []

def test_heap_with_time_over_60_minutes():
    arr = [58, 59, 60]
    assert solution(arr) == ['00:58', '01:00', '01:02']

def test_large_heap():
    arr = [i for i in range(100)]
    expected = [f"{value // 60:02}:{value % 60:02}" for value in range(100)]
    assert solution(arr) == expected
```
<|Test End|>

The above code provides a solution function that checks if the array represents a min heap and converts the array to the desired format if it does. The test cases are designed to handle different scenarios to ensure the correctness of the solution. Make sure that your Python environment includes pytest to run these tests correctly.
