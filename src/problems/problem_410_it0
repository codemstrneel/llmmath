QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of strings, where each string represents a URL containing a date in "YYYY/MM/DD" format, and a target integer. For each string, extract the year, month, and day from the URL using regular expressions. Calculate the sum of the year, month, and day, and check if this sum is divisible by the target integer. If divisible, modify the URL by interchanging the positions of the year and the day within the URL. Then, divide the list of modified URLs into smaller sublists, each containing n URLs, discarding any URLs that do not fit into complete sublists. Return the list of sublists.
