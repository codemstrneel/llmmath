QUESTION

Write a Python function that combines advanced analysis of sequences in a list of integers with more complex word processing in a given string. The function should take a list of integers and a string containing words.

The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify and return all sequences in the list of integers where consecutive numbers differ by exactly 2 and the sequence is part of a larger arithmetic progression.

2. Count the number of words in the string, excluding any words under four characters.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- A list of identified sequences with a difference of 2 among consecutive integers, ensuring they are part of a larger arithmetic progression.
- The total count of words in the string meeting the specified length criteria.

This problem involves recognizing and analyzing advanced numerical patterns, alongside more nuanced text-based analysis, providing a challenging integration of both numeric and text processing.

from typing import List, Tuple

def analyze_sequence_and_string(numbers: List[int], text: str) -> Tuple[List[List[int]], int]:
