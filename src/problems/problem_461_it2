QUESTION

Write a function that generates a square matrix of size n x n. This matrix should be filled with all possible products formed by distinct sublists of length 2 from the list of numbers `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Arrange these products in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner of the matrix.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It looks like the current solution incorrectly assumes that all cells in the matrix should be filled with products, which isn't always possible because the number of products is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), while the matrix is \(n \times n\). If \(n > 2\), the matrix should accommodate only the available products, with the remaining cells being zero or left as they are.

Let's adjust the solution to ensure the matrix is correctly filled spirally with available products, and I'll also update the tests accordingly.

def solution(n):
    """

    """
    if n < 2:
        return [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    from itertools import combinations

    # Get all distinct pairs using combinations from itertools
    pairs = combinations(range(1, n + 1), 2)
    # Calculate products
    products = sorted(a * b for a, b in pairs)
    
    # Initialize the n x n matrix with zeroes
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    # Fill with products in a spiral order
    dirs = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]  # right, down, left, up
    x, y, d = 0, 0, 0
    for product in products:
        matrix[x][y] = product
        # Determine the next position
        nx, ny = x + dirs[d][0], y + dirs[d][1]
        if not (0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and matrix[nx][ny] == 0):  # change direction
            d = (d + 1) % 4
            nx, ny = x + dirs[d][0], y + dirs[d][1]
        x, y = nx, ny

    return matrix

These updates accommodate filling the matrix only up to the number of the available products and correctly arrange them in a spiral pattern.
