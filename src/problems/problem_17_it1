QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a string and an integer, and an integer n as inputs. First, rearrange the tuples in alphabetical order based on the string values. Then, create a square matrix filled with elements that are powers of the integers from the sorted tuples, arranged in spiral order, with the power being the integer n. After constructing the matrix, compare the total character count of all the strings with the sum of the digits of the smallest number in the matrix when formatted without leading zeros. Return True if they match, otherwise return False.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's update the solution and tests to handle the cases correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that the number of pairs in the list allows for a square matrix to be formed, meaning the number of pairs should be a perfect square. Additionally, we'll improve the test cases to reflect meaningful test scenarios.

Here's the revised version:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(pairs, n):
    import math

    # Helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
    def sum_of_digits(number):
        return sum(int(d) for d in str(number))

    # Step 1: Sort the tuples based on the string values alphabetically
    sorted_pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda x: x[0].lower())

    # Extract the integers and strings separately
    integers = [x[1] for x in sorted_pairs]
    strings = [x[0] for x in sorted_pairs]

    # Step 2: Generate powers of integers
    powers = [i ** n for i in integers]

    # Check if the total number of elements allows for a square matrix formation
    num_elements = len(powers)
    size = int(math.isqrt(num_elements))
    if size * size != num_elements:
        raise ValueError("Total number of elements must be a perfect square.")

    # Construct the spiral matrix
    matrix = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)]
    direction = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right, down, left, up
    row, col, d = 0, 0, 0  # initial position and direction

    for number in powers:
        matrix[row][col] = number
        # compute next position
        next_row, next_col = row + direction[d][0], col + direction[d][1]

        # check boundaries and if the cell is already filled
        if 0 <= next_row < size and 0 <= next_col < size and matrix[next_row][next_col] == 0:
            row, col = next_row, next_col
        else:
            d = (d + 1) % 4  # change direction
            row, col = row + direction[d][0], col + direction[d][1]

    # Find the smallest number in the matrix
    smallest = min(min(row) for row in matrix)

    # Sum of digits of the smallest number
    smallest_digits_sum = sum_of_digits(smallest)

    # Total character count of all strings
    total_characters = sum(len(s) for s in strings)

    # Return whether the character count matches the digit sum
    return total_characters == smallest_digits_sum
