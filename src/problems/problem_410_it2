QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of strings, where each string represents a URL containing a date in "YYYY/MM/DD" format, and a target integer. For each string, extract the year, month, and day from the URL using regular expressions. Calculate the sum of the year, month, and day, and check if this sum is divisible by the target integer. If divisible, modify the URL by interchanging the positions of the year and the day within the URL. Then, divide the list of modified URLs into smaller sublists, each containing n URLs, discarding any URLs that do not fit into complete sublists. Return the list of sublists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's review and correct the solution implementation and test cases to ensure the functionality correctly meets the requirements stated in the task.

### Key Observations:
- We need to process URLs by extracting dates (YYYY/MM/DD format) and checking if the sum of year, month, and day is divisible by a target integer.
- If divisible, we swap the year and day in the URL.
- Finally, these modified URLs should be grouped into sublists of size `n`, discarding any leftover URLs that do not fit into a complete sublist.

### Steps to Correct:
1. **Correct the Divisibility Check:** Ensure the year, month, and day are correctly summed and checked against divisibility by the target number.
2. **Implement the Swapping Logic for Year and Day:** The expected output after processing should swap the year and day parts in `YYYY/MM/DD` format.
3. **Construct Valid Test Cases:** Ensure that the expected results align with correctly executed logic for date extraction and manipulation, using valid test computations.

Here is the updated solution and test cases:

These tests should now correctly reflect the functionality of the solution and verify that date manipulation and divisibility checks work as intended.
