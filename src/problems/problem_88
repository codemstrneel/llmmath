QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and an integer k, and returns the count of string pairs such that both strings have the same character frequencies and are present at indices that are divisible by k.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Sure, let's tackle the problem step by step. We need to write a function that analyzes pairs of strings in a list based on their character frequencies and relative position in the list.

### Solution Outline
1. The function `solution` will take two inputs: a list of strings and an integer `k`.
2. We'll need to identify pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that:
   - `i` and `j` are both in the range of the list.
   - `i` and `j` are divisible by `k`.
   - Strings at these indices have the same character frequencies.
3. To compare character frequencies, using a dictionary (or `collections.Counter` in Python) is efficient.
4. We'll iterate through possible pairs, compare character frequencies, and count those that match.

Here's the implementation:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
from collections import Counter

def solution(strings, k):
    """
    Returns the count of string pairs such that both strings
    have the same character frequencies and are present at indices that are divisible by k.
    
    :param strings: List of strings to be analyzed
    :param k: Integer value that indices must be divisible by
    :return: Integer count of valid string pairs
    """
    n = len(strings)
    count = 0
    
    # Generate all valid index pairs
    for i in range(n):
        if i % k != 0:
            continue
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if j % k != 0:
                continue
            if Counter(strings[i]) == Counter(strings[j]):
                count += 1
    
    return count
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_example_case():
    assert solution(["abc", "bca", "cab"], 1) == 3

def test_no_valid_indices():
    assert solution(["abc", "def", "ghi"], 2) == 0

def test_all_same_characters():
    assert solution(["aaa", "aaa", "aaa"], 1) == 3

def test_different_frequencies():
    assert solution(["abcd", "bcda", "dcba", "acbd"], 1) == 6

def test_zero_k():
    assert solution(["abc", "abc", "abc"], 0) == 0

def test_large_k():
    assert solution(["abc", "cab", "bca"], 5) == 0

def test_varied_lengths():
    assert solution(["a", "b", "c", "a"], 2) == 1

def test_k_greater_than_length():
    assert solution(["abc", "abc"], 3) == 0
<|Test End|>

The tests verify the function by examining various cases such as:
- When strings are identical in frequency and located at indices divisible by `k`.
- Cases where no indices are valid.
- Handling edge cases of `k` equals 0 or values greater than the list length.
