QUESTION

Write a function that takes a camel case string representation of fractional numbers, converts it to a snake case string, and then sums the fractions as a single float.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears there was an issue with the syntax due to the inclusion of triple quotes that made the code segments appear as strings rather than executable blocks. We'll correct the syntax errors by ensuring the implementation doesnâ€™t contain markdown-specific syntax when intended for execution.

Let me update the solution and tests, making sure they are fully executable without syntax issues.

### Correct Solution and Tests

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import re
from fractions import Fraction

# Mapping from string representations to fraction objects
fraction_map = {
    "onehalf": Fraction(1, 2),
    "onethird": Fraction(1, 3),
    "onequarter": Fraction(1, 4),
    "threeeighths": Fraction(3, 8),
    "threefifths": Fraction(3, 5),
    "onefifth": Fraction(1, 5),
    "onesixth": Fraction(1, 6),
    "oneeighth": Fraction(1, 8),
    "onetenth": Fraction(1, 10),
    "ninetyninehundredths": Fraction(99, 100)
}

def solution(camel_case_string):
    """
    Converts a camel case string of fractional numbers to separate words,
    parses the fractions, and returns their sum as a float.
    """
    # Find components by splitting camel case
    components = re.findall(r'[A-Z][a-z]*', camel_case_string)
    
    # Join split components and convert them to lowercase
    joined_components = "".join(components).lower()
    
    # Split into actual separate fraction words
    result = 0.0
    current_word = ""

    # We scan through the string, finding the valid mapped fractions
    for char in joined_components:
        current_word += char
        if current_word in fraction_map:
            result += float(fraction_map[current_word])
            current_word = ""

    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_known_composites():
    assert abs(solution("OneHalfOneThird") - (1/2 + 1/3)) < 1e-9
    assert abs(solution("OneQuarterThreeEighths") - (1/4 + 3/8)) < 1e-9

def test_single_fraction():
    assert abs(solution("ThreeFifths") - (3/5)) < 1e-9
    assert abs(solution("OneThird") - (1/3)) < 1e-9
    assert abs(solution("NinetyNineHundredths") - (99/100)) < 1e-9

def test_no_fractions():
    assert solution("") == 0.0

def test_mixed_cases():
    assert abs(solution("OneHalfOneThird") - (1/2 + 1/3)) < 1e-9

def test_unmapped_fractions():
    # Testing an input containing an unmapped fraction "OneSixteenth"
    assert abs(solution("OneEighthOneSixteenth") - (1/8)) < 1e-9
    # Tests when no recognizable fractions exist
    assert solution("SomeRandomText") == 0.0
<|Test End|>

This implementation and its tests are now appropriately formatted to eliminate syntax errors when executed. It should be robust, successfully interpreting the mapped camel case string fractions, and summing them accurately.
