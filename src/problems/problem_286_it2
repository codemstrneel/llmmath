QUESTION

Write a function that finds the second most repeated string in a given sequence and then verifies if this string matches a pattern where the string starts with the letter 'a', followed by zero or more of any characters, and ends in 'b'. Return both the second most repeated string and a boolean indicating whether it matches the pattern.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the task requirements and the test output, it seems like we need to address the logic in both the solution and the test cases more carefully. Let's first verify the solution logic and then create more appropriate test cases.

1. **Solution Logic**: The solution looks correct in logic for counting and determining the second most common element. The issue might be arising due to how the tests are expected to output results. We need to ensure that the second most occurring string is found accurately.

2. **Test Cases**: They must reflect the behavior expected from the solution function. It should directly account for frequency comparisons and selection.

Let's revise the solution (if needed) and particularly adjust test cases according to the requirements:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(strings):
    from collections import Counter
    import re
    
    # Count frequencies of each string
    frequency = Counter(strings)
    
    # Get the list of most common elements along with their counts
    common = frequency.most_common()
    if len(common) < 2:
        return (None, False)  # In case there aren't at least two different strings
    
    # Identify the second most common element
    second_most_common = common[1][0]
    
    # Check if the second most common string matches the pattern
    pattern = r'^a.*b$'
    matches_pattern = bool(re.match(pattern, second_most_common))
    
    return (second_most_common, matches_pattern)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_second_most_repeated_simple():
    # Simple test case where the second most has a clear appearance count
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "apple", "banana", "banana", "apb"]) == ('apple', False)

def test_second_most_repeated_with_pattern_match():
    # Second most repeated matches the pattern
    assert solution(["apple", "ab", "apple", "banana", "ab", "ab"]) == ('apple', False)

def test_multiple_ties_in_frequencies():
    # Test ties in frequency but with clear second based on list order
    assert solution(["abc", "aab", "accb", "abc", "abc", "aab", "accb", "accb"]) == ('aab', True)

def test_single_element_list():
    # Only one element, can't have second most
    assert solution(["apple"]) == (None, False)

def test_no_elements_list():
    # An empty list has no second most repeated element
    assert solution([]) == (None, False)

def test_strings_without_any_pattern_match():
    # No strings match the pattern
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]) == ('banana', False)

def test_ensures_proper_pattern():
    # Verify string that fits the pattern
    assert solution(["aaa", "aba", "aaa", "acb", "aba", "acb"]) == ('aba', True)

def test_case_insensitivity_does_not_apply():
    # Check case sensitivity in pattern
    assert solution(["aAb", "aab", "aba"]) == ('aba', True)
<|Test End|>

With these refined test cases, we should ensure that each aspect of determining the second most common string and pattern match is being tested accurately according to the requirements provided in the task.
