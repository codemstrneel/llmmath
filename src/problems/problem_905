QUESTION

Write a function to merge overlapping intervals from a list of intervals.

SOL & TESTS

To solve the problem of merging overlapping intervals, we first sort the intervals based on the start times. We then iterate through the sorted intervals and merge any overlapping intervals based on their end times.

Here's the solution:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    """
    Merges overlapping intervals and returns a list of the consolidated intervals.
    
    Each interval is represented as a list or tuple with two elements [start, end].
    """
    if not intervals:
        return []
    
    # Sort intervals based on the start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged_intervals = [intervals[0]]
    
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        prev = merged_intervals[-1]
        if current[0] <= prev[1]:
            # If the current interval overlaps with the previous, merge them
            merged_intervals[-1] = [prev[0], max(prev[1], current[1])]
        else:
            # No overlap, add the current interval
            merged_intervals.append(current)
    
    return merged_intervals
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import merge_intervals

def test_no_intervals():
    assert merge_intervals([]) == []

def test_no_overlap():
    assert merge_intervals([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

def test_complete_overlap():
    assert merge_intervals([[1, 5], [2, 6], [3, 7]]) == [[1, 7]]

def test_partial_overlap():
    assert merge_intervals([[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7], [6, 8]]) == [[1, 4], [5, 8]]

def test_touching_intervals():
    assert merge_intervals([[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [5, 6]]) == [[1, 3], [4, 6]]

def test_mixed_intervals():
    assert merge_intervals([[1, 10], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]) == [[1, 10], [15, 18]]
```
<|Test End|>

These test cases cover an empty list, non-overlapping intervals, complete overlaps, partial overlaps, touching intervals, and a mix of differing scenarios to ensure the function behaves as expected.
