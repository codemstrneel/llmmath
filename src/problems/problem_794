QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of mixed data types (including tuples, integers, and other types) and performs the following tasks:

1. Count the number of elements in the list until the first tuple is encountered.
2. Check if this identified tuple contains a specified element `k`.
3. If the tuple contains the element `k`, reverse the list up to the position where this tuple is located.
4. Additionally, implement the ability to handle nested lists, where elements within nested lists should also be counted as part of the total element count before the first tuple is encountered.
5. Return both the count of elements and the modified list based on the above criteria.

    Process a list containing mixed data types, count elements until

    Parameters:
    data (list): The list containing mixed data types.
    k (any): The element to check within the first encountered tuple.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the count of elements and the modified list.
