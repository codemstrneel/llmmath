QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of strings in camel case format, separates the strings into two lists based on whether the total number of characters in each string is odd or even, and then converts each string to snake case format using regex. Finally, return a tuple containing both lists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there are some issues in the test cases regarding the categorization of strings as odd or even in length and the use of undefined variables. Let's correct these issues:

1. Ensure we correctly categorize strings into odd or even length lists.
2. Fix the undefined variable errors.
3. Correctly separate the test logic to handle the actual categorization logic based on the problem requirements.

Let's proceed with the corrected solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
import re

def solution(camel_case_strings):
    """
    Converts camelCase strings to snake_case and separates them into two lists based on the total number of characters
    being odd or even.
    
    :param camel_case_strings: List of strings in camelCase format.
    :return: Tuple containing two lists - first list with snake_case strings of odd length, second list with snake_case strings of even length.
    """
    odd_length_snakes = []
    even_length_snakes = []

    for string in camel_case_strings:
        # Convert camelCase to snake_case using regex
        snake_case_string = re.sub(r'(?<!^)(?=[A-Z])', '_', string).lower()
        
        # Partition the snake_case strings into odd and even length lists
        if len(snake_case_string) % 2 == 0:
            even_length_snakes.append(snake_case_string)
        else:
            odd_length_snakes.append(snake_case_string)

    return (odd_length_snakes, even_length_snakes)

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_with_mixed_case_strings():
    camel_case_strings = ["camelCase", "simpleTest", "anotherTestExample"]
    odd_snakes, even_snakes = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert "camel_case" in even_snakes  # even length: 10
    assert "simple_test" in odd_snakes  # odd length: 11

def test_solution_with_even_length_strings():
    camel_case_strings = ["Test", "simpleTest"]
    odd_snakes, even_snakes = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert "test" in even_snakes  # even length: 4
    assert "simple_test" in odd_snakes  # odd length: 11

def test_solution_with_empty_list():
    camel_case_strings = []
    result = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert isinstance(result, tuple)
    assert result == ([], [])

def test_solution_with_single_word_strings():
    camel_case_strings = ["Word", "AnotherWord"]
    odd_snakes, even_snakes = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert "word" in even_snakes  # even length: 4
    assert "another_word" in odd_snakes  # odd length: 12

def test_solution_with_no_upper_case_strings():
    camel_case_strings = ["nocamelcase"]
    odd_snakes, even_snakes = solution(camel_case_strings)
    assert "nocamelcase" in odd_snakes  # odd length: 11
<|Test End|>

These corrections align the test cases with expected outcomes based on even and odd character length after conversion to snake case.
