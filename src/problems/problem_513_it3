QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a string representing a quadratic equation and returns a modified version of the string where whitespace is replaced by underscores. Additionally, the function should return a boolean indicating whether the quadratic has real solutions.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears that the test `test_solution_negative_coefficients` failed in the second attempt because it incorrectly calculated whether there were real solutions given the discriminant. Let's fix the test and ensure the solution is accurately determining real solutions.

First, let's double-check the correct calculation of the discriminant for the equation `-x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0`:

- Here, \( a = -1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -2 \).
- The discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4*(-1)*(-2) = 9 - 8 = 1 \).

Since the discriminant is positive, the equation does have real solutions. Therefore, our test validation should reflect this outcome.

Let's correct the test case:

<|Solution Begin|>
import re

def solution(equation):
    """
    Replace whitespace in the quadratic equation with underscores and check if the equation has real solutions.
    
    Args:
    equation: str - Quadratic equation of the form "ax^2 + bx + c = 0".
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (str, bool) - Modified equation with underscores and a boolean indicating if real solutions exist.
    """
    # Replace whitespace with underscores
    modified_equation = equation.replace(" ", "_")
    
    # Extract coefficients a, b, c from the equation using a more flexible pattern
    pattern = r"([-+]?\d*)x\^2\s*([-+]?\d*)x\s*([-+]?\d*)"
    match = re.search(pattern, equation.replace(" ", ""))

    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Equation does not match the required quadratic form ax^2 + bx + c.")

    a, b, c = match.groups()
    
    # Handling empty strings for coefficients
    def convert_coeff(coeff):
        if coeff in ["", "+"]:  # If empty or just '+', it represents 1
            return 1
        elif coeff == "-":      # If '-', it represents -1
            return -1
        else:
            return int(coeff)

    a = convert_coeff(a)
    b = convert_coeff(b)
    c = convert_coeff(c)
    
    # Calculate discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    
    # Determine if the quadratic equation has real solutions
    has_real_solutions = discriminant >= 0
    
    return modified_equation, has_real_solutions

<|Test End|>

The correction includes the correct expectation for negative coefficients resulting in real solutions and ensures the test cases check comprehensive scenarios.
