QUESTION

Create a Python function that calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given non-negative integer.

SOLUTION/TESTS

I noticed there's an issue with the previous execution environment due to a syntax error. Let's ensure everything is formatted correctly for execution. The solution formula \( 2^n \) is correct for the sum of binomial coefficients, and we'll make sure the code reflects that.

Here's the corrected output with accurate code block tagging:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n):
    """
    Returns the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given non-negative integer n.
    This sum is equal to 2^n.
    """
    return 2 ** n
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_zero():
    assert solution(0) == 1

def test_solution_small_numbers():
    assert solution(1) == 2
    assert solution(2) == 4
    assert solution(3) == 8

def test_solution_medium_numbers():
    assert solution(10) == 1024

def test_solution_large_numbers():
    assert solution(20) == 1048576
    # Test an edge case with a larger n; the sum should be 2^50, ensuring large integer handling.
    assert solution(50) == 1125899906842624
```
<|Test End|>

These changes ensure that the solution and its tests are correctly formatted and verify the expected functionality, ready to be run in an appropriate execution environment.
