QUESTION

Here is a new coding question that combines core concepts from the given questions:

**New Question:**

Develop a Python function that takes a singleton tuple containing only one list of integer tuples and a target integer. The function should perform the following steps:

1. Convert each tuple within the list of tuples from a tuple of strings to a tuple of integers.
2. Check whether each integer in the newly converted tuple can be expressed as the sum of two squares.
3. Sort this list of integer tuples based on the last element of each tuple.
4. Multiply adjacent elements within each tuple, appending a new value to the tuple representing the product of these elements.
5. Create a new list of such tuples, excluding any where the product computed in step 4 equals the target integer.

For example:

```python
def process_and_filter_tuples(singleton_tuple, target):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage:
singleton_tuple = ([('1', '4'), ('3', '18'), ('2', '5')], )
target = 12
print(process_and_filter_tuples(singleton_tuple, target))
```

**Explanation:**
- The function first converts the tuple strings to integers, e.g., ('1', '4') becomes (1, 4).
- It checks if each integer can be expressed as a sum of two squares.
- The list of tuples is then sorted based on their last element.
- It computes the product of adjacent elements in each tuple and excludes tuples where this product matches the target integer.
