QUESTION

Write a function that accepts a string representing a polygon, rotates the string representation by a specified number of positions to the right, and then checks if the resulting string can be converted into a valid integer, simulating the conversion of Roman numerals to integers (but confined to numeric strings). If valid, calculate the perimeter of a regular polygon using the value as both the number of sides and the side length. The function should handle cases where the input does not lead to a valid integer or a valid polygon.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To refine our solution and tests, we need to ensure that:
1. The rotation is performed safely (e.g., avoiding division or modulo by zero).
2. We handle cases with valid integers but invalid polygon side counts correctly.
3. The perimeter calculation uses the correct formula given that the value represents both the side length and the number of sides.

Let's correct the value assumed for perimeter calculation and ensure the test cases properly validate the solution's functionality.

    # Handle cases where rotation is larger than the length of the string

    # Rotate the string to the right
    rotated_str = polygon_str[-rotation:] + polygon_str[:-rotation]

    try:
        sides_and_length = int(rotated_str)

        return "Invalid Rotation: Cannot convert to a valid integer."

    # A valid polygon must have at least 3 sides
    if sides_and_length < 3:
        return "Invalid Polygon: Less than 3 sides."

    # Calculate the perimeter
    perimeter = sides_and_length * sides_and_length
    
    return perimeter

These modifications focus on correctly rotating the string and validating the resulting integer, accurately representing the problem constraints.
