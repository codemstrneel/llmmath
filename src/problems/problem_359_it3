QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list as input and groups every two adjacent elements into sublists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's fix the compilation errors caused due to incorrect formatting in the code blocks and make sure all tests are written correctly. We will also ensure the solution code is formatted properly.

The solution and the unit tests are correctly structured, but formatting tags such as triple backticks were used incorrectly. We need to ensure proper formatting when presenting the solution and tests.

Here is the correct version:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(lst):
    """
    Takes a list and groups every two adjacent elements into sublists.
    If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element will be in a sublist by itself.

    Parameters:
    lst (list): The list to group.

    Returns:
    list: A list of sublists, where each sublist contains up to two elements from the input list.
    """
    return [lst[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(lst), 2)]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_even_number_of_elements():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

def test_odd_number_of_elements():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]

def test_single_element():
    assert solution([1]) == [[1]]

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([]) == []

def test_string_elements():
    assert solution(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) == [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]

def test_mixed_elements():
    assert solution([1, 'b', 3, 'd', True]) == [[1, 'b'], [3, 'd'], [True]]

def test_large_list():
    input_list = list(range(1, 101))  # List from 1 to 100
    expected = [[i, i + 1] for i in range(1, 100, 2)]
    assert solution(input_list) == expected
```
<|Test End|>

This should now run correctly without any syntax errors in the execution environment.
