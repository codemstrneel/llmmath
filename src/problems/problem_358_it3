QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of dictionaries with each dictionary containing a sequence of numbers and a key as inputs. Your function should perform two tasks:

1. For each dictionary, determine if its sequence forms an increasing trend. If it does, identify the maximum value in the sequence.
2. Transform each sequence that shows an increasing trend into a format where adjacent pairs of numbers in the sequence become key-value pairs within the dictionary, excluding the maximum number. Store these dictionaries in a list.

Additionally, given an integer n, evaluate if the indices of the successfully transformed dictionaries form numbers that represent an increasing sequence based on the last digit of each index. Return a tuple containing the list of transformed dictionaries and a boolean indicating whether the index conditions are met.

Ensure to handle scenarios where inputs might lead to exceptions gracefully, and strive to keep computational efficiency in mind.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's review and correct the solution and associated tests according to the task requirements. We need to ensure that:

1. Increasing sequences in dictionaries are identified.
2. Transforming each sequence into pairs should exclude pairs when the maximum number in the sequence acts as the destination.
3. The boolean should correctly determine if the indices form an increasing sequence based on their last digits after the transformation.

Here is the revised solution and unit tests:

    Tuple[List[Dict[int, int]], bool], tuple containing the transformed list and a boolean.

This revision corrects the errors and ensures the transformation logic aligns with the problem statement accurately. The tests now reflect what should happen in various scenarios.
