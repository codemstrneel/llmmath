QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a function that flattens a deeply nested list of mixed data types, such as integers, strings, tuples, and other nested lists, into a single list while removing any specified data type from this list. For example, given a list, you may need to flatten it while removing all integers or tuples. Furthermore, after flattening the list, ensure that any subsequences formed by characters from strings present in the list have embedded rules. Specifically, no two subsequences should have the same starting or ending character sequence from their respective original positions, no subsequence should entirely overlap another, and each subsequence must contain at least one vowel to be considered valid.

SOL & TESTS

## Solution:

To tackle the problem, let's go through the steps needed:

1. **Flattening the List**: This involves recursively processing the input list, as it can contain nested lists. We'll need a helper function to do that while ignoring specified data types.

2. **Removing Specified Types**: As we flatten the list, we will filter out elements of the specified data type.

3. **Handling Strings and Subsequence Rules**:
   - Extract subsequences from strings.
   - Ensure subsequences start or end distinctly and contain at least one vowel.
   - Use a set to store processed subsequences, guarding against overlaps and embedding rules.

Let's implement this solution in code.

```python
def flatten_and_filter(data, remove_type):
    def flatten(lst):
        for item in lst:
            if isinstance(item, list):
                yield from flatten(item)
            elif not isinstance(item, remove_type):
                if isinstance(item, str):
                    yield from handle_string(item)
                else:
                    yield item

    def handle_string(s):
        vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
        processed = set()

        def is_valid_subsequence(seq):
            return any(char in vowels for char in seq)

        n = len(s)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                sub_seq = s[i:j]
                if sub_seq and is_valid_subsequence(sub_seq):
                    processed.add(sub_seq)

        return processed

    return list(flatten(data))
```

## Test:

To ensure our solution works correctly, we'll write unit tests.

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import flatten_and_filter

def test_flatten_and_filter_no_removal():
    data = [1, 'hello', [2.5, 'world', ['nested', ('tuple', 42)]], 'sky']
    result = flatten_and_filter(data, tuple)
    assert result == [1, 'hello', 2.5, 'world', 'nested', 42, 'sky']

def test_flatten_and_filter_remove_integers():
    data = [1, 'abc', [3, 'def', ['ghi', 4]], 'jkl']
    result = flatten_and_filter(data, int)
    expected = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']
    assert all(sub in result for sub in expected)

def test_flatten_and_filter_removes_tuples():
    data = [1, 'interview', [3, 'test', ['ghi', (10, 20)]], 'jkl']
    result = flatten_and_filter(data, tuple)
    expected_elements = [1, 'interview', 3, 'test', 'ghi', 'jkl']
    assert all(elem in result for elem in expected_elements)

def test_flatten_and_filter_string_handling():
    data = ['overlap']

    result = flatten_and_filter(data, int)
    expected_subsequences = {'o', 'ov', 'ove', 'over', 'overl', 'overla', 'overlap', 
                             'ver', 'versch', 've', 'erla', 'lap', 'ap', 'p'}

    assert set(result).issubset(expected_subsequences)

def test_flatten_and_filter_only_strings():
    data = ['apple', 'orange']
    result = flatten_and_filter(data, int)
    expected_subsequences_for_apple = {'a', 'ap', 'app', 'appl', 'apple', 'pple', 'ple', 'le', 'e'}
    expected_subsequences_for_orange = {'o', 'or', 'ora', 'oran', 'orang', 'orange', 'range', 'ang', 'nge', 'ge', 'e'}

    assert any(sub in result for sub in expected_subsequences_for_apple)
    assert any(sub in result for sub in expected_subsequences_for_orange)
```
