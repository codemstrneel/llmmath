QUESTION

### New Question:

Create a Python function `enhanced_data_analysis` that combines aspects of analyzing both tuples and strings to perform the following tasks:

1. **Unique Year Pair Check:**
   - Input: A list of tuples. Each tuple consists of integers representing years.
   - Task: Identify pairs of tuples where their years (each tuple has two years) have a combined sum that is a prime number. Return these pairs.
   
2. **Advanced String Manipulation:**
   - Input: Each tuple also includes a list of strings.
   - Task: For each tuple, create a new concatenated string by removing duplicates (case-insensitive) from the string list while preserving order. Calculate the factorial of the total length of this concatenated string.
   
3. **Combined Analysis with Perfect Squares:**
   - Input: Each tuple includes a list of integers.
   - Task: For each tuple, count how many numbers are perfect squares within the list of integers and replace all non-square numbers with `-1` in this list. Calculate the percentage of perfect squares present.
   
4. **Chinese Zodiac Year Feature:**
   - Extend the analysis to determine the Chinese Zodiac sign for the earliest year found in the list of year tuples in the dataset. Include this sign as an additional piece of information in your final result.

The function should return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a tuple from the input and includes:
- A list of tuples that form prime number year pairs.
- The factorial of the concatenated, deduplicated string length.
- The modified integer list (after replacements) and the perfect square percentage.
- The Chinese zodiac sign associated with the earliest year in the dataset.

This question integrates tuple and list manipulation, string and integer processing, uniqueness checks, and leverages mathematical concepts such as prime numbers and factorials, alongside incorporating cultural knowledge through the Chinese Zodiac.

SOL & TESTS

Certainly, let's break down the solution for the `enhanced_data_analysis` function that will perform complex operations on the tuples and return the required detailed analysis.

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations
from datetime import date

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def dedupe_string_list(strings):
    """Create a concatenated string from a list with duplicates removed, case-insensitive."""
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for s in strings:
        lower_s = s.lower()
        if lower_s not in seen:
            seen.add(lower_s)
            result.append(s)
    return ''.join(result)

def factorial(n):
    """Compute the factorial of a non-negative integer n."""
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative numbers do not have a factorial.")
    return math.factorial(n)

def chinese_zodiac(year):
    """Determine the Chinese Zodiac sign for a given year."""
    zodiacs = ['Monkey', 'Rooster', 'Dog', 'Pig', 'Rat', 'Ox', 'Tiger', 'Rabbit', 'Dragon', 'Snake', 'Horse', 'Goat']
    return zodiacs[(year - 1900) % 12]

def is_perfect_square(n):
    """Check if a number is a perfect square."""
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return n == root * root

def enhanced_data_analysis(data):
    """Perform data analysis combining tuple and string operations."""
    results = []
    
    # Determine the earliest year for zodiac purposes
    all_years = [year for tpl in data for year in tpl[0:2]]
    
    if not all_years:
        earliest_year = date.today().year
    else:
        earliest_year = min(all_years)
        
    zodiac_sign = chinese_zodiac(earliest_year)
    
    for tpl in data:
        years, string_list, numbers = tpl
        
        # Unique Year Pair Check
        prime_pairs = []
        for (y1, y2) in combinations(years, 2):
            if is_prime(y1 + y2):
                prime_pairs.append((y1, y2))
        
        # Advanced String Manipulation
        concatenated_string = dedupe_string_list(string_list)
        string_factorial = factorial(len(concatenated_string))
        
        # Combined Analysis with Perfect Squares
        perfect_squares_count = 0
        modified_numbers = []
        
        for num in numbers:
            if is_perfect_square(num):
                perfect_squares_count += 1
                modified_numbers.append(num)
            else:
                modified_numbers.append(-1)
        
        perfect_square_percentage = (perfect_squares_count / len(numbers) * 100) if numbers else 0
        
        # Compile result
        result = {
            "prime_year_pairs": prime_pairs,
            "string_factorial": string_factorial,
            "modified_number_list": modified_numbers,
            "perfect_square_percentage": perfect_square_percentage,
            "chinese_zodiac": zodiac_sign
        }
        
        results.append(result)
    
    return results
```

Now, let's write our unit tests for the above function using `pytest` style.

```python
import pytest
from solution import enhanced_data_analysis

def test_enhanced_data_analysis_with_example_data():
    data = [
        ([1994, 1996], ["hello", "world", "Hello"], [1, 4, 5, 2]),
        ([2000, 2013], ["Python", "PyThon", "python"], [9, 25, 30, 13]),
        ([2023, 2022], ["animal", "Animal"], [16, 23, 24, 49])
    ]
    
    results = enhanced_data_analysis(data)
    
    assert len(results) == len(data)
    
    # Check structure of result dictionary
    first_result = results[0]
    assert "prime_year_pairs" in first_result
    assert "string_factorial" in first_result
    assert "modified_number_list" in first_result
    assert "perfect_square_percentage" in first_result
    assert "chinese_zodiac" in first_result
    
    # Specific checks
    assert results[0]["prime_year_pairs"] == []  # 1994+1996, 1994+1996 are not prime
    assert results[0]["string_factorial"] == factorial(10)  # "hello" + "world" = "helloworld", len=10
    assert results[0]["modified_number_list"] == [1, 4, -1, -1]  # 1, 4 are perfect squares, others are not
    assert results[0]["perfect_square_percentage"] == 50.0  # 2 out of 4 are perfect squares
    assert isinstance(results[0]["chinese_zodiac"], str)
    
    assert results[1]["string_factorial"] == factorial(6)  # "Python", deduplication keeps "Python", len=6
    assert results[1]["perfect_square_percentage"] == 50.0  # [9, 25] are perfect squares

def test_chinese_zodiac_resolution():
    # Test specific for Chinese Zodiac determination
    data = [
        ([1900, 2020], [], [])  # Both fall into the 'Rat'
    ]
    results = enhanced_data_analysis(data)
    assert results[0]["chinese_zodiac"] == "Rat"
```

Make sure to include both the solution function and test cases in a module that can be imported correctly for testing with pytest.
