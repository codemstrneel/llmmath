QUESTION

Write a Python function that processes a matrix of tuples, where each tuple contains a set of integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Remove duplicate rows, where two rows are considered duplicates if their sets of integers are equivalent.

2. For each unique row, perform the following:
   - Calculate the sum of all integers in the row.
   - Determine if this sum is a perfect square and can also be represented as the sum of squares of two distinct non-negative integers (the distinctness condition for integers still applies).

3. If the condition is met, take the sum of the integers, convert it into a string, and extract the first three continuous characters from the string. If there are fewer than three characters, extract all available characters.

4. If the condition about representing the sum as both a perfect square and a sum of squares is not met, omit that row from the results.

5. Return a list of extracted strings for those rows meeting the condition.
