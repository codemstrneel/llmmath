QUESTION

**New Question:**

Develop a Python function that takes two lists of integers and performs the following steps:

1. **Filter Processing**:
   - Use a lambda function and a list comprehension to filter out only the odd integers from both lists.
   - Combine the filtered odd integers from both lists into a new list.

2. **Binary Analysis**:
   - Convert each number in the new list into its binary representation and calculate the sum of their binary 'unset bits' indices.

3. **Statistics Reporting**:
   - Use formatted strings to construct and return a detailed report. The report should include:
     - The original lists of odd integers.
     - A description of each integer in binary, highlighting unset bits.
     - The total sum of unset bit indices across all numbers in the new list.

This question integrates filtering and combining lists, binary arithmetic, and formatted string outputs to generate an analytical report, requiring skills from various coding problem domains.

SOL & TESTS

Sure! Let's break down the problem and develop the solution and unit tests according to the specified format.

```python
def analyze_odd_numbers(list1, list2):
    """
    Analyzes two lists of integers by filtering odd numbers, converting them to binary,
    and calculating the sum of unset bit indices.

    Parameters:
    - list1: First list of integers.
    - list2: Second list of integers.

    Returns:
    - A formatted report as a string containing:
      1. The original lists of odd integers.
      2. A description of each integer in binary, highlighting unset bits.
      3. The total sum of unset bit indices across all numbers in the new list.
