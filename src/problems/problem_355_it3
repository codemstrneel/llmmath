QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and checks if replacing the first digit of each number with the first digit of its factorial results in a strictly increasing sequence. Additionally, ensure that the check is performed in O(n log n) time complexity and incorporate error handling for negative numbers, which should throw an exception. Use recursion to calculate factorials and the `map` function to apply the transformation to each number in the list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there were issues with formatting the code blocks correctly in previous attempts, which led to syntax errors. Let's address this by ensuring proper formatting, implementing the solution, and including a revised set of tests to verify the function behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected solution and test code:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(lst):
    def factorial(n):
        if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
        elif n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n - 1)

    def first_digit(num):
        while num >= 10:
            num //= 10
        return num

    def transformed_number(num):
        if num < 0:
            raise ValueError("Negative number encountered in the list.")

        fact = factorial(num)
        first_fact_digit = first_digit(fact)
        
        str_num = str(num)
        new_num_str = str(first_fact_digit) + str_num[1:]  # Replace first digit
        return int(new_num_str)

    transformed_list = list(map(transformed_number, lst))
    
    return all(x < y for x, y in zip(transformed_list, transformed_list[1:]))
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
import pytest

def test_solution_all_positive():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3]) == True

def test_solution_single_element():
    assert solution([5]) == True

def test_solution_non_increasing():
    assert solution([3, 2, 1]) == False

def test_solution_with_zero():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2]) == True

def test_solution_large_numbers_non_increasing():
    assert solution([10, 20, 30]) == False

def test_solution_large_numbers_increasing():
    # Transformations will ensure this sequence remains strictly increasing
    # for numbers like 1 (factorial = 1), 5 (factorial = 120), 10 (factorial starts as 1 but is not needed here).
    assert solution([1, 5, 10]) == True

def test_solution_negative_number_exception():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Negative number encountered in the list."):
        solution([-1, 3, 4])

def test_solution_complex_case():
    # Test for a known sequence that transforms into a non-increasing one
    # 9 (factorial is 362880), 2 (factorial is 2), 6 (factorial is 720); transformed: 3, 2, 7.
    assert solution([9, 2, 6]) == False
```
<|Test End|>

The above changes ensure proper syntax and format, running the solution and test suites as intended. The testing cases also intend to verify the solution for correctness under various scenarios, including zero-handling and exceptions.
