QUESTION

Write a Python function that first generates the first n Bell numbers, then checks if two given lists contain any of these Bell numbers as either elements or factors of their elements. Use a map function to assist in this process. Afterward, sort each of the two lists using heap sort. Finally, return the sorted lists along with a count of how many Bell numbers were found either as elements or factors in both lists.
