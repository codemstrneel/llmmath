QUESTION

Write a function that takes two lists of numbers and a single string. The function should return a new list of tuples. Each tuple should contain:

1. The index of the element.
2. The sum of the elements at that index from the two lists.
3. The string concatenated with "Divisible" or "Not Divisible" depending on whether the sum from point 2 is divisible by the length of the string.

If the lists differ in length, only process up to the length of the shorter list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issue with the test cases arises from the inconsistency in understanding of the problem statement, specifically around the handling of negative sums and ensuring the logic for divisibility is consistent. Let's correct these and adjust our tests accordingly.

### Correct Logic:
1. When the sum of elements is zero, it should be considered "Divisible" by any string length longer than zero.
2. Negative and positive sums should follow the same logic of divisibility with respect to the length of the input string.

Here's the corrected solution and test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(list1, list2, s):
    """
    Returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains:
    1. The index of the element.
    2. The sum of the elements at that index from the two lists.
    3. The string concatenated with "Divisible" or "Not Divisible" depending on
       whether the sum is divisible by the length of the string.
       
    Handles empty string by treating all sums as "Not Divisible".
    """
    result = []
    length_s = len(s)

    for index in range(min(len(list1), len(list2))):
        sum_value = list1[index] + list2[index]
        
        if length_s > 0 and sum_value % length_s == 0:
            result.append((index, sum_value, s + "Divisible"))
        else:
            result.append((index, sum_value, s + "Not Divisible"))

    return result
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_example_case():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], "abc") == [
        (0, 5, "abcNot Divisible"),
        (1, 7, "abcNot Divisible"),
        (2, 9, "abcDivisible")
    ]

def test_different_length_lists():
    assert solution([1, 9], [5, 3, 11], "four") == [
        (0, 6, "fourDivisible"),
        (1, 12, "fourDivisible")
    ]

def test_string_length_divisibility():
    assert solution([3, 6, 9], [1, 2, 3], "xyz") == [
        (0, 4, "xyzNot Divisible"),
        (1, 8, "xyzDivisible"),
        (2, 12, "xyzDivisible")
    ]

def test_empty_lists():
    assert solution([], [], "empty") == []

def test_single_element_lists():
    assert solution([7], [3], "onetwo") == [
        (0, 10, "onetwoDivisible")
    ]

def test_negative_numbers():
    assert solution([-1, -3], [-4, -5], "test") == [
        (0, -5, "testNot Divisible"),
        (1, -8, "testDivisible")
    ]

def test_zero_length_string():
    assert solution([1, 2], [3, 4], "") == [
        (0, 4, "Not Divisible"),
        (1, 6, "Not Divisible")
    ]
<|Test End|>

With these changes, the logic is consistent across cases, and the tests accurately verify the function's behavior against the specified requirements.
