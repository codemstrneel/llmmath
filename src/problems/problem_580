QUESTION

Sure, let's create a new question by combining elements from the provided questions. We'll blend concepts of list manipulation, which involves trapezium area calculation and modulo arithmetic, and enhance it a bit with Roman numeral conversion.

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes three lists as input:
- The first list contains the bases of several trapeziums.
- The second list contains the heights corresponding to each trapezium.
- The third list consists of tuples. Each tuple has two integers, \( a \) and \( b \).

The function should return a dictionary where:
1. Each key is the Roman numeral representation of the sum of bases for the trapeziums whose areas are even numbers.
2. The corresponding value for each key is a modified list of trapezium areas:
   - Calculate the area of each trapezium using the formula \(\text{Area} = \frac{{\text{base} \times \text{height}}}{2}\).
   - Remove every k'th area from the list of areas, where \( k \) is the sum of the tuple \( (a + b) \) modulo the number of trapeziums.

Ensure the function handles edge cases such as lists of different lengths or empty lists appropriately. Additionally, provide a helper function to convert integers into Roman numerals for use within your main function.
