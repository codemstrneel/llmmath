QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and a list of complex numbers as input. First, filter out all negative numbers from the list of numbers and convert each remaining number to its string representation. Then, for each complex number, convert it into its polar coordinates and remove any with negative magnitudes. After these steps, calculate and return a tuple that contains two elements: a list of strings from the filtered numbers that are substrings of any word in the original list of complex numbers (converted to strings in polar form), and the polar coordinate set with the smallest positive magnitude from the filtered list of complex numbers.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import cmath

def solution(numbers, complex_numbers):
    # Filter out negative numbers and convert remaining to strings
    filtered_numbers = [str(num) for num in numbers if num >= 0]
    
    # Convert complex numbers to polar coordinates
    polar_coordinates = [(cmath.polar(cn), cn) for cn in complex_numbers]
    
    # Filter out complex numbers with negative magnitude
    filtered_polar = [(polar, cn) for polar, cn in polar_coordinates if polar[0] >= 0]
    
    # Convert complex numbers to polar form strings
    complex_str = [f"{polar[0]:.4f}+{polar[1]:.4f}j" for polar, cn in filtered_polar]
    
    # Filter the list of strings that are substrings in any complex number string
    substrings = [num_str for num_str in filtered_numbers if any(num_str in c_str for c_str in complex_str)]
    
    # Find the polar set with the smallest positive magnitude
    min_polar = min(filtered_polar, key=lambda x: x[0][0], default=(None, None))
    
    # Return the relevant polar coordinates
    result_polar = min_polar[1] if min_polar[1] is not None else ()
    
    return (substrings, result_polar)
