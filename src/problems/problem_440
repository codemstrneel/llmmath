QUESTION

**New Question:**

Design a Python function that takes four parameters:

1. A string containing multiple sentences.
2. A list of words.
3. A list of integers.
4. A list of floating-point numbers.

The function should perform the following tasks, inspired by the concepts in the given questions:

1. **String Analysis:**
   - Normalize the input string by removing duplicate consecutive consonants (e.g., "happppy" becomes "hapy").
   - Identify the frequency of each word triplet (three consecutive words) in the text and the most common triplet.

2. **Word and Integer Analysis:**
   - From the list of words, construct a dictionary where each unique word is a key and the value is the sum of the lengths of the strings in which this word appears in the string list.
   - Create a list of increasing integer sequences found in the list of integers, but consider only sequences where each integer is separated by exactly 1. Return a list of the lengths of these sequences.

3. **Floating-Point Number Analysis:**
   - Create a dictionary where each unique floating-point number is a key. The value is a tuple containing:
     - The frequency of that number in the list.
     - Its formatted string representation rounded to two decimal places.
   - Filter and include only numbers greater than their frequency in the dictionary.

4. **Combined Analysis:**
   - Find the number of unique vowels found before each instance of a number in the list of integers (after converting each number to a string form).
   - Calculate the sum of ASCII values of all vowels from the original string.
  
The function should return a tuple with four elements:

- A dictionary containing the most common word triplet and their frequency.
- A tuple containing the word-length sum dictionary and the list of lengths of increasing sequences.
- The modified dictionary of floating-point numbers with frequency and rounded string.
- A tuple with the count of unique vowels and the sum of their ASCII values.

```python
def integrated_analysis(text, word_list, int_list, float_list):
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

This novel function integrates string processing through consonant normalization, word triplet frequency calculation, word length summation, integer sequence analysis, floating-point frequency handling, and vowel analysis across multiple data types, pulling together various aspects of the given topics.
