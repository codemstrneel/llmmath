QUESTION

Certainly! Here's a new question that combines core concepts from the given questions:

**New Coding Question:**

Write a Python function that combines sequential number processing, substring reversal, and basic character frequency analysis. The function should take a list of integers (representing numerical data) and a string (representing a sentence or code snippet) as input. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify and return all sequences in the list of integers where each consecutive number is divisible by the previous one, forming a cascading sequence.

2. Reverse any subsequence of characters in the string that appears between parentheses, excluding the parentheses themselves. If multiple nested parentheses exist, only apply the transformation to the outermost pair.

3. Count how many distinct consonant characters appear in the original string, ignoring case sensitivity.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- A list of identified cascading sequences from the integer list.
- The modified string with reversed segments as specified.
- The total count of distinct consonant characters.

**Explanation:**

This question synthesizes elements from the source questions by requiring considerable depth in handling both numeric sequences and string manipulations. Task 1 focuses on identifying specific numerical patterns resembling problem-solving in Questions 1 and 3. Task 2 involves substring reversal inspired by Question 2, but spans across identified segments within structured text. Task 3 involves character frequency analysis concerning consonants, somewhat analogous to character counting in Question 3 but focusing on consonant uniqueness. This novel question thus demands a multidimensional approach, integrating sequence analysis, substring manipulations, and character frequency assessment within a unified framework.

SOL & TESTS

Sure! Let's tackle this task by solving each of the subproblems in a step-by-step manner.

### Subproblem 1: Identify cascading sequences
To identify cascading sequences in the list of integers, we need to find sequences where each number is divisible by the previous one. We'll iterate through the list and track such sequences.

### Subproblem 2: Reverse subsequences between parentheses
For the string manipulation, we'll traverse the string, identify content within the outermost parentheses, and reverse it without altering the nested structure.

### Subproblem 3: Count distinct consonants
Lastly, we'll count distinct consonants in the given string, ignoring case sensitivity.

Let's write the function and corresponding unit tests.

            elif c == ')' and stack:
                start = stack.pop()
                if not stack:  # Only process if it is the outermost
                    new_string[start + 1:i] = reversed(new_string[start + 1:i])
        
        return ''.join(new_string)

        vowels = set('aeiou')
        consonants = set()
        
        for char in s.lower():
            if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels:
                consonants.add(char)
        
        return len(consonants)

    cascading_sequences = find_cascading_sequences(numbers)
    modified_string = reverse_outer_parentheses(input_string)
    distinct_consonant_count = count_distinct_consonants(input_string)
    
    return (cascading_sequences, modified_string, distinct_consonant_count)
