QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of tuples and performs the following operations: First, convert each tuple into a set. Then, for each element in these sets, raise the element to the power of its index within the tuple (assuming all elements are integers). Finally, return a single set containing all the unique results from these operations. Use lambda functions and the map function to achieve this.

def process_tuples(list_of_tuples):
    """
    Given a list of tuples, converts each tuple into a set, raises each element in the sets
    to the power of its index within the tuple, and returns a set of the unique results.
    
    Args:
        list_of_tuples (list of tuple of int): A list of tuples with integer elements.

    Returns:
        set of int: A set containing unique powers calculated for each tuple element.

**Explanation:**
The solution processes each tuple by converting it to a set and applying a lambda function that raises each element to the power of its index. The final result is the union of these processed sets. The tests cover various cases, including empty input, single and multiple tuples, overlapping elements, handling of large numbers, and tuples with negative numbers.
