QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that processes two inputs: a list of integer ranges and a list of sentences. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify distinct subsequences from the list of integer ranges. A subsequence is valid if each range (a, b) can be sequentially connected to another range (c, d) where b < c. The goal is to find the longest valid chain of these subsequences, echoing the idea of a directed acyclic sequence.
   
2. For the identified longest chain of integer ranges, extract and construct phrases from the provided list of sentences. Each integer range (a, b) defines indices to extract words from each sentence such that words indexed from 'a' to 'b' are included inclusively. Only consider ranges that yield unique words when extracted.
   
3. Return these constructed phrases as a list ensuring no two phrases overlap indices within the same sentence and that each phrase contains at least one palindrome word as defined in the index range.

**Example Input:**
- Ranges: `[(1, 4), (3, 6), (7, 9)]`
- Sentences: `["this is an example of a sentence", "palindrome madam racecar refer"]`

**Expected Output:**
- List of non-overlapping phrases: `["is an example", "madam racecar"]`

This question combines the concepts of identifying subsequences from a set of ranges (inspired by linking and longest sequence determination), using specific index-based extraction (from the substrings and list indexing ideas), and ensuring uniqueness criteria with additional properties such as palindromes.
