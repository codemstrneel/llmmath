QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a function to calculate the harmonic sum of a number `n`, where `n` is represented not as a decimal number, but as a binary number that has been left-rotated by one position. The function should return two values: the computed harmonic sum and the equilibrium index of an array constructed by inserting each digit of the left-rotated binary number into an array. If a binary equilibrium index does not exist, return -1 for the index.

**Explanation:**

1. **Left Rotate Binary Number:**
   - Convert the number `n` to its binary form.
   - Perform a left rotation by one bit on the binary representation.

2. **Harmonic Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate the harmonic sum of this rotated binary number interpreted as a decimal number.

3. **Equilibrium Index:**
   - Construct an array with each digit of the left-rotated binary number.
   - Find the equilibrium index of this array, i.e., an index such that the sum of elements at lower indices is equal to the sum of elements at higher indices.

4. **Output:**
   - Return the harmonic sum and the found equilibrium index (or -1 if none exists).

This question combines concepts of binary manipulation (left-rotating bits), harmonic series calculation, and equilibrium indices, thus synthesizing elements from the given questions to create a novel problem.
