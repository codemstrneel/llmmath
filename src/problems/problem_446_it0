QUESTION

Write a function that generates a square matrix filled with all possible products of pairs formed by elements from 1 to n (inclusive). Arrange the products in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner of the matrix.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Certainly! Below is the solution to generate a square matrix filled with all possible products of pairs formed by elements from 1 to `n` and arranged in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner, along with the unit tests to verify the solution.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n):
    # Step 1: Generate the products of pairs (i, j) where 1 <= i, j <= n
    products = [i * j for i in range(1, n + 1) for j in range(1, n + 1)]
    # Sort the products
    products.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Create an n x n matrix
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Step 3: Fill the matrix in a spiral order
    top, bottom, left, right = 0, n - 1, 0, n - 1
    idx = 0
    
    while top <= bottom and left <= right:
        # Move right
        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            matrix[top][i] = products[idx]
            idx += 1
        top += 1
        
        # Move down
        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
            matrix[i][right] = products[idx]
            idx += 1
        right -= 1
        
        if top <= bottom:
            # Move left
            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):
                matrix[bottom][i] = products[idx]
                idx += 1
            bottom -= 1
        
        if left <= right:
            # Move up
            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):
                matrix[i][left] = products[idx]
                idx += 1
            left += 1
    
    return matrix

These test cases check against different values of `n` and ensure that the spiral matrix aligns with the expected output. The tests are implementation-independent as they only verify the presence of correct elements in the required spiral order.
