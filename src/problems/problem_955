QUESTION

Write a Python function that processes a list of integer pairs and a list of strings. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify the longest chain of pairs in which each pair (a, b) can be connected to another pair (c, d) if b â‰¤ c.
2. Within this longest chain, each pair (a, b) will determine indices to extract characters from the provided list of strings. From each string, extract characters located at positions corresponding to indices 'a' to 'b' inclusively.
3. Construct a new list of non-overlapping character sequences by ensuring that the extracted subsequences are continuous and unique.
4. Return the list of these character sequences while maintaining the relative order of the original pairs.

```python
def longest_chain_and_extract(chars_pairs, strings):
    """
    Identifies the longest chain of pairs and extracts character sequences from strings 
    based on the indices specified in the pairs.
    
    Parameters:
    chars_pairs (list of tuples): List of integer pairs (a, b).
    strings (list of str): List of strings to extract characters from.
    
    Returns:
    list: List of non-overlapping character sequences.
    """
    # Sort pairs based on the end value of each pair
    chars_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Find the longest chain of pairs
    n = len(chars_pairs)
    longest_chain = []
    current_end = -1
    
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = chars_pairs[i]
        if a >= current_end:
            longest_chain.append(chars_pairs[i])
            current_end = b + 1
