QUESTION

Write a function to find the minimum of two numbers without using any comparison operators.

SOL & TESTS

To find the minimum of two numbers without using comparison operators directly, we can utilize mathematical operations. One way to achieve this involves using the formula for the minimum of two numbers:

\[
\text{min}(a, b) = \frac{a + b - |a - b|}{2}
\]

This formula works by averaging \(a\) and \(b\) while correcting for the distance between them. The absolute difference \(|a - b|\) essentially determines which number is smaller, leveraging the absolute value function to implicitly perform a comparison. Below is the solution implementing this approach, followed by unit tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def find_min(a, b):
    """
    Returns the minimum of two numbers a and b without using direct comparison.
    """
    return (a + b - abs(a - b)) // 2
```
<|Solution End|>
<|Test Begin|>
```python
import pytest
from solution import find_min

def test_find_min_positive_numbers():
    assert find_min(10, 15) == 10

def test_find_min_negative_numbers():
    assert find_min(-3, -5) == -5

def test_find_min_mixed_sign_numbers():
    assert find_min(-7, 5) == -7

def test_find_min_equal_numbers():
    assert find_min(4, 4) == 4

def test_find_min_with_zero():
    assert find_min(0, 5) == 0
    assert find_min(-3, 0) == -3

def test_find_min_large_numbers():
    assert find_min(100000, 50000) == 50000
```
<|Test End|>

The solution provided in the `find_min` function calculates the minimum without directly comparing the values using traditional comparison operators like `<` or `>`, but instead, uses mathematical operations to achieve the same result. The accompanying tests cover various scenarios, ensuring the function is robust and behaves as expected for different input values.
