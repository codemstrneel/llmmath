QUESTION

Write a function that generates a square matrix of size n x n. This matrix should be filled with all possible products formed by distinct sublists of length 2 from the list of numbers `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Arrange these products in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner of the matrix.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there is a mismatch between the expected number of products and the matrix size, which affects the logic of filling the matrix spirally. We need to resolve these issues and correct both the solution and test cases accordingly.

### Solution Plan:
The distinct pairs result in \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) products for a given list `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The spiraling should correctly arrange these products, and any remaining spaces should be zeros.

### Updated Solution and Tests:

    if n < 2:
        return [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    from itertools import combinations

    # Get all distinct pairs using combinations from itertools
    pairs = combinations(range(1, n + 1), 2)
    # Calculate products
    products = sorted(a * b for a, b in pairs)
    
    # Initialize the n x n matrix with zeroes
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    # Fill with products in a spiral order
    dirs = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]  # right, down, left, up
    x, y, d = 0, 0, 0

        matrix[x][y] = product
        # Determine the next position
        nx, ny = x + dirs[d][0], y + dirs[d][1]
        if not (0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and matrix[nx][ny] == 0):  # change direction

            nx, ny = x + dirs[d][0], y + dirs[d][1]

These corrections are intended to address the earlier issues and ensure the products are placed into the matrix correctly according to the algorithm described.
