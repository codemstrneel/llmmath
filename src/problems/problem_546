**Novel Question:**

**Title:** Process and Transform Integer Tuples with Conditional Chunking and Power Sum Analysis

**Description:**

Write a Python function that processes a list of integer tuples and an integer \( k \). The function should perform the following stages:

1. **Exclusion Stage:** Remove any tuple where all integers are either even or all are greater than 100.
2. **Transformation Stage:** For each remaining tuple, invert the sign of each integer if the sum of the tuple is divisible by 3.
3. **Chunking and Sorting Stage:** Divide the transformed list of tuples into subgroups of size \( k \). For each subgroup:
   - Sort the tuples within each subgroup by the sum of the cubes of their integers in descending order.
   - After sorting, calculate the sum of the fifth powers of all integers in each subgroup and replace the subgroup list with this single sum.
4. **Final Output Stage:** Return a list containing the sum of fifth powers for each subgroup.

**Examples:**
- Given the integer tuples `[(102, 3, 5), (6, 3, 6), (200, 4, -99), (7, 23, 2)]` with \( k \) as 2, the function processes through exclusion, transformation, chunking, and sorting, and outputs a list with the sum of the fifth powers of integers in each subgroup.
- For tuples `[(1, 2, 3), (9, 27, 0), (6, 9, 3), (14, 42, 21)]` with \( k \) as 3, follow through the steps to generate and return the final transformed result.

This task challenges you to synthesize concepts of conditional filtering, mathematical transformations, subgroup management, and power operations.

```python
def process_and_transform_tuples(tuples, k):
    # Stage 1: Exclusion Stage
    processed_tuples = [
        t for t in tuples 
        if not (all(x % 2 == 0 for x in t) or all(x > 100 for x in t))
    ]
    
    # Stage 2: Transformation Stage
    def should_invert(t):
        return sum(t) % 3 == 0
    
    processed_tuples = [
        tuple(-x if should_invert(t) else x for x in t)
        for t in processed_tuples
    ]
    
    # Stage 3: Chunking and Sorting Stage
    from math import pow

    def sum_of_cubes(t):
        return sum(x ** 3 for x in t)
    
    def sum_of_fifth_powers(subgroup):
        return sum(x ** 5 for t in subgroup for x in t)
    
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(processed_tuples), k):
        subgroup = processed_tuples[i:i+k]
        subgroup.sort(key=sum_of_cubes, reverse=True)
        power_sum = sum_of_fifth_powers(subgroup)
        result.append(power_sum)
    
    # Stage 4: Final Output Stage
    return result
```
