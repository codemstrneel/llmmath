QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and an integer \( n \), and performs the following operations to produce a transformed result:

1. **Initial Transformation Phase:** 
   - Remove all spaces from each string.
   - Filter out any string that contains any character that is not a letter or a digit (e.g., punctuation marks).

2. **Grouping and Inversion Calculation:**
   - Group the cleaned strings based on their initial characters. Within each group, count the occurrences of each string.
   - For each string within a group, calculate inversions relative to their lexicographical order within that group.

3. **Chunking and Summation:**
   - Divide the groups into chunks of size \( n \).
   - For each chunk, compute the sum of lengths of all strings within that chunk, and return a list of tuples containing this sum and a sub-list of strings ordered by their calculated inversions (from step 2).

4. **Final Condition:**
   - Exclude any chunk where all strings have zero inversions.

**Example:**
Given the list `[" abC ", "cde!", "123", "{}()", "ABc", "AbC!", "cde"]` and chunk size \( n = 2 \), the function first cleans the strings, filters out invalid ones, groups by initial characters, calculates inversions, chunks the groups, and applies all conditions specified.

**Explanation of Combos:**

- The new question integrates concepts from several given questions:
  - **String Cleaning:** Aligns with tasks from Question 5 to preprocess strings by removing irrelevant characters.
  - **Grouping and Counting:** Draws from the counting and inversion themes in Questions 1 and 5, ensuring that string groupings and inversion calculations are key elements.
  - **Chunking:** Combines the idea of chunking from Questions 2 and 3, reimagining it in the context of grouped strings and inversion analysis.
  - **Final Filtering:** Uses a conditional exclusion step akin to logic in Questions 3 and 4, introducing complexity in the final output determination.

    import re
    from collections import defaultdict
    from itertools import groupby
    
    # Step 1: Initial Transformation Phase
    cleaned_strings = [''.join(ch for ch in s if ch.isalnum()) for s in strings if s.strip()]
    
    # Filter out any string that contains non-alphanumeric characters only
    alphanumeric_strings = [s for s in cleaned_strings if re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$', s)]
    
    # Step 2: Grouping and Inversion Calculation
    groups = defaultdict(list)
    
    for s in alphanumeric_strings:
        groups[s[0].upper()].append(s)
    
    inversion_dict = {}
    
    for group in groups.values():
        group.sort()  # Sort the group for inversion calculation
        
        inversions = [0] * len(group)
        
        for i in range(len(group)):
            inversions[i] = sum(1 for j in range(i) if group[j] > group[i])
        
        inversion_dict.update({string: inv for string, inv in zip(group, inversions)})
        
    # Step 3: Chunking and Summation
    result = []
    
    for _, group in groups.items():
        for i in range(0, len(group), n):
            chunk = group[i:i+n]
            inversion_chunk = sorted(chunk, key=lambda x: inversion_dict[x])
            
            if any(inversion_dict[x] > 0 for x in chunk):
                total_length = sum(len(s) for s in chunk)
                result.append((total_length, inversion_chunk))
