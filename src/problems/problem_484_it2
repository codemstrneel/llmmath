QUESTION

Write a function to add two integers. However, if the sum is within a specified range, return a fixed value of 20 instead.

SOLUTION/TESTS

There are some issues in the unit tests related to boundary conditions during testing. Let's correct that and ensure the tests accurately reflect the desired behavior.

Here's the corrected solution and updated unit tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(a, b, lower_bound=10, upper_bound=19, fixed_return=20):
    """
    Returns the sum of a and b. 
    If the sum falls within the specified range [lower_bound, upper_bound], 
    returns fixed_return instead.
    """
    sum_ab = a + b
    if lower_bound <= sum_ab <= upper_bound:
        return fixed_return
    return sum_ab
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_sum_within_range():
    assert solution(5, 5) == 20  # sum is exactly lower_bound
    assert solution(9, 1) == 20  # sum is exactly lower_bound
    assert solution(10, 9) == 20 # sum is exactly upper_bound
    assert solution(14, 5) == 20 # sum is within the range

def test_sum_outside_range():
    assert solution(5, 4) == 9   # sum is below lower_bound
    assert solution(-10, -1) == -11 # negative sum
    assert solution(20, 1) == 21 # sum is above upper_bound
    
def test_sum_on_boundaries():
    assert solution(10, 0) == 20 # edge case where result is lower_bound
    assert solution(19, 0) == 20 # edge case where result is upper_bound
    assert solution(9, 0) == 9   # just below lower_bound
    assert solution(20, -10) == 10 # sum right on edge of lower_bound but not within

def test_with_custom_bounds():
    assert solution(4, 1, lower_bound=0, upper_bound=10, fixed_return=21) == 5  # within the default range but below the custom range
    assert solution(6, 5, lower_bound=10, upper_bound=12, fixed_return=30) == 30 # sum is within custom bounded range
    assert solution(15, 15, lower_bound=10, upper_bound=29, fixed_return=15) == 15 # custom range sum within

<|Test End|>

By correcting the test cases, we ensure that we are appropriately checking the boundary values and applying conditions of fixed return for sums both inside and outside custom specified ranges.
