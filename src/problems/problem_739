QUESTION

**New Question:**

You are required to develop a Python function that performs advanced analysis and manipulation on a mixed list while integrating bitwise operations and regular expressions. The function should address the following tasks:

1. **Pattern Extraction:** Identify sequences within a mixed list (containing strings, integers, and nested lists) where an uppercase letter is followed by at least two lowercase letters and then a digit (this pattern must appear within strings). Use regular expressions to find such patterns and store them in a dedicated list.

2. **Bitwise Manipulation and Counting:** For each integer in the list (only consider numbers that can be grouped into threes), count and store the total number of unset bits (0s) from the binary representation of each integer. Also, for these integers, reverse only the odd-positioned bits in their total binary representation. If fewer than three integers can be grouped, leave them as they are.

3. **Sorting Mechanism:** Implement a custom sorting function that organizes the extracted patterns in alphabetical order. Meanwhile, among the integers that have undergone bitwise operations, store them in descending order based on the total number of unset bits.

4. **Unique Identifier Construction:** Construct a unique identifier that concatenates the sorted patterns into a non-redundant string, preserving the sequence of their initial occurrence. Utilize the `collections` module to eliminate duplicates efficiently.

5. **Dictionary Compilation:** The function should return a dictionary capturing:
   - The final string of unique patterns under the key "unique_patterns".
   - A list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer processed from task 2 and its corresponding count of unset bits, stored under the key "modified_numbers_info".

Ensure that your function is robust, efficiently handles large datasets, and leverages Python's libraries for enhanced performance where suitable.
