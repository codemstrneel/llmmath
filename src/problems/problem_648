QUESTION

**Novel Combined Question:**

Write a Python function that processes a matrix of tuples (similar to Question 1) and a second list of strings (inspired by Question 4). The function should perform the following tasks:

1. In the list of strings, identify those that start with the letter 'x' and end with the letter 'y'.

2. For the matrix of tuples, remove duplicate rows, considering rows as duplicates if they have the same sets of integers.

3. For each unique row in the matrix, perform the following operations:
   - Calculate the XOR of all integers in the row and check if this XOR result can be found in the first four rows of Pascal's Triangle (considering only positive integers and ignoring zero).
   - If the XOR result is present in Pascal's Triangle rows, replace each string in the list that matches the pattern 'x...y' (from step 1) with the number of numeric characters in that string. If not, use '?' in place of those strings.

4. Return a list where each element corresponds to a row of the matrix, containing either the transformed integers or '?'.

### Example:

Given the string list and matrix:

```python
strings = ["x123y", "apple", "xi12y", "banana", "x999y"]

matrix = [
    [(1, 2)], 
    [(3, 1, 3)], 
    [(4, 5)], 
    [(7, 8, 9)]
]
```

**Processing Steps:**

- Identify strings starting with 'x' and ending with 'y': `["x123y", "xi12y", "x999y"]`

- Remove duplicate rows in the matrix (none in this case).

- Calculate XORs and check conditions using Pascal's Triangle:
    - For row [(1, 2)], XOR is 3 (present in Pascal's first few rows), so replace `["x123y", "xi12y", "x999y"]` with the count of numeric characters: `[3, 2, 3]`.
    - For row [(3, 1, 3)], XOR is 1 (present), so produce `[3, 2, 3]`.
    - For row [(4, 5)], XOR is 1 (present), so produce `[3, 2, 3]`.
    - For row [(7, 8, 9)], XOR is 6 (not present), so produce `['?', '?', '?']`.

**Result:**

```python
[
    [3, 2, 3], 
    [3, 2, 3], 
    [3, 2, 3], 
    ['?', '?', '?']
]
```

This question combines the concept of string pattern identification, matrix row duplication removal, integer manipulation using XOR operations, and mathematical property checks through the use of Pascal's Triangle, resulting in a diverse and multi-faceted coding challenge.

SOL & TESTS

Sure, let's break down the solution for the given task.

### Solution Steps

1. **Identify Strings with Specific Pattern:**
   - Gather all strings that start with `'x'` and end with `'y'`.

2. **Remove Duplicate Rows in Matrix:**
   - Consider rows duplicate if their sets of integers are identical.

3. **XOR Operation for Each Row:**
   - Compute the XOR of numbers in each row.
   - Check if the result exists in the first four rows of Pascal's Triangle.

4. **Transform Strings Based on XOR Result:**
   - If the XOR is present, replace each identified string with its count of numeric characters.
   - Otherwise, substitute with `'?'`.

5. **Construct Result:**
   - Return a list of transformed strings for each row.
