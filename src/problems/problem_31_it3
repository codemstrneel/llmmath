QUESTION

Write a function that takes in a binary tree and returns the sum of two lists where each list is generated by applying a lambda function on the heights of all leaf nodes. The first list should contain the Fibonacci numbers corresponding to these heights calculated using recursion, while the second list should contain polite numbers corresponding to these heights. Use the `map` function to generate these lists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It looks like the `TreeNode` class definition is missing in the test file. Let's address that issue by including the `TreeNode` class definition within the test code. Also, it seems there might be a mix-up in calculating some expected Fibonacci and polite numbers because, initially, the Fibonacci of 0 was erroneously treated as 1 and the polite number calculation may have encountered incorrect indexing logic. Let's ensure that we correctly implement these aspects. Here is the corrected solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
def fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate Fibonacci number recursively."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

def polite_numbers(n):
    """Get polite numbers via calculation sequence."""
    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2 - 1

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        
def solution(root):
    """ 
    Takes in a binary tree and returns the sum of two lists. One list contains Fibonacci
    numbers of the heights of leaf nodes, and the other contains polite numbers.
    """
    def get_leaf_heights(node, current_height):
        if node is None:
            return []
        if node.left is None and node.right is None:
            return [current_height]
        return get_leaf_heights(node.left, current_height + 1) + get_leaf_heights(node.right, current_height + 1)
    
    # Get heights of all leaf nodes
    leaf_heights = get_leaf_heights(root, 0)
    
    # Generate lists by applying mappings as lambda functions
    fib_list = list(map(lambda x: fibonacci(x), leaf_heights))
    polite_list = list(map(lambda x: polite_numbers(x), leaf_heights))
    
    return sum(fib_list), sum(polite_list)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import TreeNode, solution

def test_solution_empty_tree():
    assert solution(None) == (0, 0)

def test_solution_one_node():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    # Leaf height is [0]
    # Fibonacci number [0], Polite number [-1]
    assert solution(root) == (0, -1) 

def test_solution_balanced_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3))
    # Leaf heights are [1, 1]
    # Fibonacci numbers [1, 1], Polite numbers [0, 0]
    assert solution(root) == (2, 0)

def test_solution_unbalanced_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4)), TreeNode(3))
    # Leaf heights are [2, 1]
    # Fibonacci numbers [1, 1], Polite numbers [2, 0]
    assert solution(root) == (2, 2)

def test_solution_complex_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1, 
                    TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), 
                    TreeNode(3, None, TreeNode(6)))
    # Leaf heights are [2, 2, 2]
    # Fibonacci numbers [1, 1, 1], Polite numbers [2, 2, 2]
    assert solution(root) == (3, 6)
<|Test End|>

These updates should address the missing `TreeNode` definition within the test scope as well as ensure that both the Fibonacci and polite number calculations are accurately reflecting their mathematical definitions.
