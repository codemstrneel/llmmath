QUESTION

Write a function that processes a given list of tuples, removes any that are empty, and then identifies the top k tuples based on the combined criteria of having the highest sum of numeric elements and the fewest empty strings within each tuple. If multiple tuples have the same sum, prioritize those with fewer empty strings. In cases of further ties, prefer tuples with the smallest lexicographical order.

SOLUTION/TESTS

I apologize for the previous formatting errors. Let's correctly provide the solution and tests without any syntax issues:

### Objective
The aim is to implement a function that filters and processes a list of tuples based on specific criteria and returns the top `k` tuples. The criteria are:
1. Filter out any empty tuples.
2. Prioritize based on the highest sum of numeric elements.
3. Minimize the count of empty strings.
4. Resolve ties by lexicographical order.

Here's the correct formatted solution and unit test:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(tuples_list, k):
    """
    Processes a given list of tuples, removing any that are empty, and then identifies
    the top k tuples based on the combined criteria of highest sum of numeric elements,
    fewest empty strings, and smallest lexicographical order in case of ties.
    """
    
    def tuple_criteria(t):
        numeric_sum = sum(x for x in t if isinstance(x, (int, float)))
        empty_string_count = sum(1 for x in t if x == "")
        # The sorting will be by -numeric_sum for descending order by sum,
        # then by empty_string_count for ascending order by fewer empty strings,
        # and then by the tuple itself in lexicographical order for ties.
        return (-numeric_sum, empty_string_count, t)
    
    # Remove empty tuples
    non_empty_tuples = [t for t in tuples_list if t]
    
    # Sort tuples based on the criteria
    sorted_tuples = sorted(non_empty_tuples, key=tuple_criteria)
    
    # Return the top k tuples
    return sorted_tuples[:k]
```

This solution and these tests are correctly formatted for Python execution, with conditions checked to ensure the function works as required across various scenarios.
