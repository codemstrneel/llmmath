QUESTION

Write a Python function that, given a list of lists, reorders each inner list such that all odd elements come before the even elements, and then calculates the sum of a specific column index from the reordered list of lists.

    Reorders each inner list in 'data' such that all odd elements come before the even elements.
    Then calculates the sum of elements at a specific column index from the reordered list of lists.
    
    :param data: List of lists containing integers.
    :param col_index: Index of the column to sum after reordering.
    :return: Sum of the elements at the specified column index after reordering lists.
