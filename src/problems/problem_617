QUESTION

Create a Python function that processes a matrix of tuples, where each tuple contains a set of integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Remove duplicate rows, where two rows are considered duplicates if their sets of integers are equivalent.
2. For each unique row, calculate the capitalized string representation of the ordinal values of the XOR of each integer pair in the row.
3. Sort the resulting string representations lexicographically.

The function should return a list of strings, each representing the sorted result of the calculations for a unique row.

def process_matrix(matrix):

    Processes a matrix of tuples as per the specified tasks.
    
    1. Remove duplicate rows based on tuple set equivalence.

    Args:
    - matrix (list of tuples): A matrix where each row is a tuple of integers.
