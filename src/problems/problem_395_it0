QUESTION

Create a function that processes tuples and lists in parallel. Given a tuple and a list, both consisting of integers, the function should create subgroups of size n from both the tuple and list. It should then find the subgroup pair (one from the tuple and one from the list) such that the absolute difference between the sums of the elements of the subgroups is minimized. If there are leftover elements that do not fit into a complete subgroup of size n, they should be discarded.
