QUESTION

Write a Python function that generates a square matrix filled with consecutive integers starting from 1 in spiral order. From this matrix, identify the first four unique integers located on the corners of the innermost spiral layer. Calculate the area of the tetrahedron using these four integers as the lengths of its edges. Then, generate all unique sublists from these four integers where each sublist has a maximum length of 2, and rotate each sublist to the right by a specified number of positions, wrapping around appropriately if necessary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issue encountered was due to the code being wrapped originally in ```` blocks which is not valid within the given code editor environment. Letâ€™s resolve the problem by removing unnecessary backticks and correcting the logical issues with the logic of capturing spiral corners and rotating sublists. I'll provide an updated solution and test cases.
