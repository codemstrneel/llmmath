QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of integers, a list of tuples, and a single integer m. The function should:

1. Use a lambda function to filter out numbers from the list of integers that are divisible by m or by at least one of the integers present in any tuple from the list of tuples (ignoring any None values in those tuples).
2. Construct a list from these filtered numbers to obtain tuples where each tuple contains the index and value of each filtered number.
3. Return a list of tuples containing: 
   - The sum of values from step 2.
   - Whether or not the sum is a polite number â€” a number that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive integers.
   - The even parity (True if even, False if odd) of the count of tuples from step 2.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question. We'll define a function that filters a list of integers based on certain criteria and processes them to produce the required output. Below is the fully detailed solution and the accompanying unit tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(integers, tuples, m):
    """
    This function processes integers based on divisibility, tuple filtering,
    and evaluates the sum for being a polite number, and checks even parity.
    """
    # Extract integer values from the tuples, ignoring None
    divisors = {m}
    for tpl in tuples:
        divisors.update({x for x in tpl if x is not None})

    # Filter integers that are not divisible by any of the collected divisors
    filtered = [(i, val) for i, val in enumerate(integers) if all(val % d != 0 for d in divisors)]
    
    # Calculate the sum of the values of the filtered numbers
    sum_values = sum(val for _, val in filtered)
    
    # Determine if the sum is a polite number
    # (A polite number is a number that can be represented as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers)
    # All positive integers except powers of 2 are polite numbers.
    is_polite = (sum_values & (sum_values - 1)) != 0
    
    # Determine the even parity of the count of tuples
    is_even_parity = len(filtered) % 2 == 0
    
    return [(sum_values, is_polite, is_even_parity)]

<|Test End|>

This code will systematically check the function's behavior with varying conditions, ensuring the logic handles all edge cases appropriately, including no divisors, no integers to filter, and testing different output characteristics.
