QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes as input two elements:

1. A list of integer ranges, where each range is a tuple \((start, end)\) using zero-based indexing, defining sublists to extract from an input list of numbers. The function should identify and return the longest sequence of these ranges where each range \((a, b)\) in the sequence has \(b < c\) for the subsequent range \((c, d)\). This should form a continuous, non-overlapping chain of valid sublists.

2. A target string from which you will remove nested tuples within parentheses. The nested tuples can appear within the string as `(a, b, (c, d), e)`. The function should recursively remove all such nested tuples, ensuring that only the outermost tuples remain in the result.

Combine both of these processed outputs to create and return a new string. Stringify the numbers from the identified longest chain of integer ranges, separated by hyphens, and concatenate this with the processed string with removed nested tuples.

**Example Input:**
- Ranges: `[(0, 2), (3, 5), (6, 8), (3, 7)]`
- Numbers: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]`
- Target String: `"Here is a tuple (1, 2, (3, 4, (5, 6)), 7)"`

**Expected Output:**
- String: `"10-20-30-40-50-60  Here is a tuple (1, 2, 7)"`

This question combines elements from identifying non-overlapping chains from integer ranges (concept of longest sequence extraction) and processing a complex structure (nested tuples) within a string, maintaining only specific instances (outermost tuples) consistent with prior removal tasks.
