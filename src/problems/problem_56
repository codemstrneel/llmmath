QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of nested tuples and identifies tuples where the first element starts with a positive integer. For each identified tuple, subtract the nested elements of these tuples, and then sort the resulting values alphabetically based on their string representation. Return the sorted list of resulting values.
