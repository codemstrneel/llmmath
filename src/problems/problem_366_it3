QUESTION

Create a function that calculates the sum of the nth element in a list of lists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The primary issue appears to be related to the format within the code execution environment. Let's ensure that the provided solution and tests are structured correctly for a typical Python environment. We need to make sure the solutions and tests are straightforward Python code without unnecessary markdown formatting. Let's correct this:

- Review the solution code to ensure it handles the addition correctly.
- Ensure that the provided tests satisfy the given constraints.
- Clarify and simplify the formatting to work within the execution environment.

Here's the corrected version:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(list_of_lists, n):
    """
    Returns the sum of the nth element in each sublist of list_of_lists.
    If a sublist does not have an nth element, it contributes zero.
    """
    nth_sum = 0
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        if len(sublist) > n and len(sublist) > 0:
            nth_sum += sublist[n]
    return nth_sum
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_nth_element_sum_all_same_length():
    list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    n = 1
    assert solution(list_of_lists, n) == 15  # 2 + 5 + 8

def test_nth_element_sum_varying_lengths():
    list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4], [7, 8]]
    n = 1
    assert solution(list_of_lists, n) == 10  # 2 + 8

def test_nth_element_sum_index_out_of_bounds():
    list_of_lists = [[1], [], [7, 8]]
    n = 2
    assert solution(list_of_lists, n) == 0  # No valid nth elements

def test_nth_element_sum_negative_indices():
    list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    n = -1
    assert solution(list_of_lists, n) == 18  # 3 + 6 + 9

def test_nth_element_sum_empty_lists():
    list_of_lists = [[], [], []]
    n = 0
    assert solution(list_of_lists, n) == 0  # No valid nth elements
```
<|Test End|>

Make sure when implementing and testing this code that it is run in a compatible Python environment where pure Python can be executed without additional markdown or annotations. The `solution` function now handles cases where lists may be empty and should correctly execute within any standard Python environment.
