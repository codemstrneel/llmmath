QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of tuples and performs the following operations: First, interchange the first and last elements of each tuple. Then, for each tuple that meets the criteria of having numbers divisible by every digit they contain, calculate the sum of those numbers. Return the total sum of all such qualifying numbers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's resolve the issues with the provided solution and test cases. The primary issue could be identified in both logic and testing expectations. We'll correct these and ensure the test suite reflects accurate validations.

### Corrected Solution

1. **Interchange mechanics**: Swap the first and last elements of each tuple.
2. **Divisibility check**: Ensure numbers are divisible by all their non-zero digits.
3. **Accumulate the sum** of qualifying numbers from the transformed tuples.

### Corrected Test Cases

Each test will ensure our function behaves as expected, both in modifying tuples and calculating sums based on divisibility criteria.

```python
def solution(tuples_list):
    def is_divisible_by_digits(num):
        """Check if a number is divisible by each of its non-zero digits."""
        num_str = str(abs(num))  # Handle negative numbers by taking absolute
        for digit_char in num_str:
            digit = int(digit_char)
            if digit == 0 or num % digit != 0:
                return False
        return True

    total_sum = 0

    for tup in tuples_list:
        # Interchange first and last elements of the tuple
        if len(tup) > 1:
            new_tup = (tup[-1],) + tup[1:-1] + (tup[0],)
        else:
            new_tup = tup

        # Sum the elements that satisfy the divisible by digits condition
        for num in new_tup:
            if is_divisible_by_digits(num):
                total_sum += num

    return total_sum
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([]) == 0

def test_single_element_tuples():
    assert solution([(3,), (7,), (12,)]) == 10  # 3 and 7 qualify

def test_no_qualifying_numbers():
    assert solution([(15, 24, 23)]) == 0  # None qualify, even with interchange

def test_all_qualifying_numbers():
    assert solution([(12, 36, 111), (84, 33, 22)]) == 262  # 12, 36, 111, 84, 33, 22 all qualify

def test_mixed_qualifying_and_non_qualifying_numbers():
    assert solution([(12, 13, 35)]) == 12  # Only 12 qualifies

def test_interchange_effect_with_divisible_check():
    assert solution([(24, 30, 18)]) == 42  # Interchanges to (18, 30, 24), only 18 qualifies

def test_single_number_in_tuple():
    assert solution([(17,), (22,), (39,)]) == 22  # Only 22 is divisible by its digits

def test_tuple_with_zero():
    assert solution([(10, 2, 20)]) == 2  # Only '2' qualifies due to presence of zero

def test_tuple_with_negatives():
    assert solution([(-12, -11, -36)]) == 12  # Only -12 converted checks 12, not -11 or -36
```

This arrangement ensures the function and test cases adhere to desired outcomes, reflecting thorough checks against tuple transformations and divisibility by digit.
