QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and a sentence as input. The function should remove all negative numbers from the list and also check if any word from the modified list of positive numbers (converted to strings) is present in the provided sentence. Return a tuple containing the modified list and a boolean indicating the presence of any word from the list in the sentence.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems like there was a misunderstanding regarding the presence of numeric words in sentences, specifically concerning the word "0" in the test titled `test_solution_with_zeros`. The failure could be due to an inaccurate string comparison since "0" typically appears with additional context like "zero". Let's ensure our tests and solution correctly distinguish between numeric strings that exist as standalone words in sentences.

Here's the corrected solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(numbers, sentence):
    """
    Takes a list of numbers and a sentence. Removes negative numbers from the list,
    and checks if any word from the modified list (converted to strings) is present in the sentence.
    
    :param numbers: List of integers
    :param sentence: A sentence string
    :return: Tuple containing the modified list and a boolean indicating presence of any number in the sentence
    """
    positive_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num >= 0]
    number_strings = set(map(str, positive_numbers))
    words = sentence.split()
    return positive_numbers, any(num_str in words for num_str in number_strings)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_empty_list():
    assert solution([], "This is a sentence.") == ([], False)

def test_solution_no_negatives():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], "We have 1 and 3.") == ([1, 2, 3], True)
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], "No numbers here!") == ([1, 2, 3], False)

def test_solution_with_negatives():
    assert solution([-1, -2, 3, 4], "I like 3 apples.") == ([3, 4], True)
    assert solution([-1, -2, -3, 4], "Available numbers are 5, 10.") == ([4], False)
    assert solution([-1, -2, -3], "Negative vibes only.") == ([], False)

def test_solution_mixed_numbers():
    assert solution([10, -10, 20, -20, 30], "We will use 10 and 20.") == ([10, 20, 30], True)
    assert solution([10, 101], "Number 101 is found.") == ([10, 101], True)

def test_solution_no_positives():
    assert solution([-1, -2, -3], "Number free zone") == ([], False)

def test_solution_with_zeros():
    assert solution([0, -10, 5], "Available number is 5.") == ([0, 5], True)
    assert solution([0, -10, 5], "Nothing is 0 here.") == ([0, 5], True)
    assert solution([0], "Zero 0 is present.") == ([0], True)
    assert solution([0], "Zero is here.") == ([0], False)
<|Test End|>

Now we are explicitly checking for standalone words that match the strings of modified numbers within the sentence. This correction ensures our solution aligns with the requirements and the tests properly validate it.
