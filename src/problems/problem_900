QUESTION

Create a Python function that performs two main tasks:

1. **Processing Tuples**: The function accepts a list of strings, where each string represents a tuple containing integers. First, convert each string into an actual Python tuple of integers. Then, compute the product of adjacent elements within each integer tuple and store these results in a new list.

2. **Advanced Sorting and Searching**: After obtaining the list of adjacent products, sort the original integer tuples by the sum of their elements in ascending order. Once sorted, identify the position of the tuple that begins with a specific target integer. If the target integer is found at the beginning of multiple tuples, return the position of its first occurrence. If the target integer is not found as the first element of any tuple, return -1.

Here is a sample function signature to illustrate how the function might be invoked:

```python
def process_and_find_tuple(tuples_str_list, target):
    # Your implementation here

tuples_str_list = ["(2, 3, 4)", "(1, 2)", "(5, 7, 6)", "(8, 1)"]
target = 5
print(process_and_find_tuple(tuples_str_list, target))
```

In this example, the integer tuples are first processed to generate a list of products of adjacent numbers. The original tuples are then sorted based on the sum of their elements. The function should return the index of the first tuple starting with the target integer, or -1 if no such tuple exists. Use 0-based indexing for position reporting.

    Processes a list of tuple strings, calculates products of adjacent elements,
    sorts tuples by sum, and finds the index of the tuple starting with a target integer.

    Args:

    - target (int): The integer to search for at the start of tuples.

    Returns:
    - int: The index of the first sorted tuple that starts with the target, or -1 if not found.

            return index

    return -1
