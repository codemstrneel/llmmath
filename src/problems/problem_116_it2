QUESTION

Write a function that takes two inputs: a list of tuples and a list of lists. Each tuple consists of two elements, and each sublist contains integers representative of potential triangle side lengths. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Group the first elements of the tuples based on their second elements. After forming these groups, for each group, if any numeric value exists in the string representation, increment each numeric by 1. Track the number of distinct groups formed.

2. For each sublist, determine if it forms a valid triangle. If it is valid and its perimeter is an even number, capture the minimum and maximum integers within the sublist and compute their difference. Sum all these differences across valid triangles.

Finally, return a tuple with two elements: the number of distinct groups formed in step 1 and the total sum of differences calculated in step 2.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there are discrepancies between the requirements and the current implementation. Let's review and correct the solution and the tests.

For the solution:

1. **Grouping and Counting Distinct Groups**: Ensure we are accurately counting distinct groups formed based on the second element in tuples.

2. **Valid Triangles with Even Perimeter**: Ensure we correctly calculate the difference between max and min side lengths for valid triangles with an even perimeter.

For the tests:

1. Ensure expected results match the defined problem requirements.

Let's address these issues and update the tests accordingly.

Here, I've ensured that test expectations reflect valid triangles with an even perimeter and the accurate count of distinct groups formed. Please run these tests in your environment to verify the solution correctness.
