QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes an integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers as input. The function should:

1. Calculate the sum of the series 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n².
2. For each number in the list, perform a specified number of right rotations on its digits. For the number of rotations, use the sum of even numbers found at even indices from the list as the rotation count.
3. Determine if any of the resulting integers from the right rotations are perfect squares.

Return a tuple containing the sum of the series and a list of booleans indicating whether each of the rotated integers is a perfect square or not.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address both the solution and potential issues observed in the testing framework.

### Observed Issues:
1. **Logical Clarification**: The initial approach had potential logical issues due to misunderstandings around list indexing and rotations. Rotations should focus on numbers with their digits rearranged conditionally based on the calculated rotation amounts.
2. **Syntax Issues**: The tests presented structural and validation flaws and inconsistency problems, concerning direct function execution or assumptions.
3. **Perfect Square Implementation**: Ensure robust checking for perfect squares.

Let’s make sure this refinement aligns closely with expected behaviors on input operations and optimal syntax handles. Here's a complete solution refocus with improved testing:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n, numbers):
    """
    Calculates the sum of series 1² + 2² + ... + n² and performs a number of right rotations on each number
    from the list based on the sum of values located at even indices that are even numbers themselves. 
    Returns a tuple with the sum of the series and list of booleans indicating whether rotated numbers are perfect squares.
    """

    # Function to determine if a number is a perfect square
    def is_perfect_square(x):
        return int(x ** 0.5) ** 2 == x

    # Function to rotate digits of a number to the right
    def rotate_digits(num, rotations):
        s = str(num)
        if len(s) <= 1:
            return num
        rotations = rotations % len(s)
        return int(s[-rotations:] + s[:-rotations])

    # Calculate sum of series 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2
    series_sum = sum(i ** 2 for i in range(1, n + 1))

    # Calculate rotation count
    rotation_count = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, len(numbers), 2) if numbers[i] % 2 == 0)

    # Evaluate rotated numbers to determine if they are perfect squares
    perfect_squares = [is_perfect_square(rotate_digits(num, rotation_count)) for num in numbers]

    return series_sum, perfect_squares

<|Test Begin|>
def test_series_sum():
    result, _ = solution(3, [123, 456])
    assert result == 14  # 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14

def test_no_rotations_due_to_no_even_numbers_at_even_indices():
    _, result = solution(5, [13, 27, 35, 19, 23])
    assert result == [False, False, False, False, False]  # No rotation occurs, check existing numbers

def test_rotation_and_perfect_square_detection():
    _, result = solution(5, [256, 100, 144, 121])
    assert result == [True, True, True, True]  # Each of these numbers is a perfect square without rotation

def test_complex_case():
    _, result = solution(3, [4, 8, 12, 16, 20])
    assert result == [True, False, False, True, False]  # 4 and 16 are perfect squares

def test_correct_rotation():
    _, result = solution(4, [15, 123, 4560, 78])
    assert result == [False, False, False, False]  # None are perfect squares after any valid rotations

def test_empty_numbers_list():
    result, outcome = solution(3, [])
    assert result == 14  # Correct series sum for n=3
    assert outcome == []  # No numbers result in empty list

def test_single_digit_numbers():
    _, result = solution(3, [1, 7, 9])
    assert result == [True, False, True]  # 1 and 9 are perfect squares

<|Test End|>
```

This ensures correct flow and outputs while addressing boundary cases and structuring test cases. Each case considers existing and rotational scenarios followed by indication in results.
