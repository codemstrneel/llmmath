QUESTION

Write a function that combines the following tasks using a list of strings and a list of lists containing integers:

1. For each string, remove all characters that are not letters or numbers using regex. Then, if the cleaned string contains any numeric values, increment each numeric value by 1. Track the count of such modified strings where the length of the string becomes an even number after modification.

2. From the list of lists, identify and return the sublist whose sum of elements is the highest. Additionally, check if this sublist, viewed as side lengths, forms a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of any two side lengths is greater than the third.

Finally, return a tuple containing two elements: the count of strings from step 1 and a Boolean indicating whether the sublist from step 2 forms a valid triangle.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems like the formatting errors stem from incorrect syntax when attempting to define the solution and test sections properly.

Let's fix this by ensuring our test cases are correctly structured and address any logical errors in both the solution and test cases.

### Corrected Solution and Tests

- The general approach for handling strings and lists should be maintained.
- Ensure all syntax is correctly applied, especially regarding the test definitions without the import statement within these directly observable solutions.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import re

def solution(strings, lists_of_numbers):
    def clean_and_modify_string(s):
        # Remove non-alphanumeric characters using regex
        cleaned = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', s)
        # Increment each numeric value by 1
        modified = ''.join(str(int(c) + 1) if c.isdigit() else c for c in cleaned)
        return modified
    
    def is_valid_triangle(sides):
        # A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third
        if len(sides) != 3:
            return False
        a, b, c = sorted(sides)
        return a + b > c

    # Step 1: Process each string
    even_length_count = 0
    for string in strings:
        modified_string = clean_and_modify_string(string)
        if len(modified_string) % 2 == 0:
            even_length_count += 1

    # Step 2: Find the sublist with the maximum sum
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_sum_sublist = []

    for numbers in lists_of_numbers:
        current_sum = sum(numbers)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_sum_sublist = numbers

    # Check if max_sum_sublist forms a valid triangle
    valid_triangle = is_valid_triangle(max_sum_sublist)

    return (even_length_count, valid_triangle)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_with_alphanumeric_strings():
    strings = ["abc123", "a1b2c3!", "#$%4&5", "789"]
    lists_of_numbers = [[3, 4, 5], [9, 15, 8]]
    # After cleaning and modifying:
    # "abc234" has length 6 (even), "a2b3c4" has length 6 (even), "45" has length 2 (even), "8910" has length 4 (even)
    # All strings have even length after modifications.
    # The sublist [9, 15, 8] forms a valid triangle as 9+8 > 15, 9+15 > 8, 15+8 > 9
    assert solution(strings, lists_of_numbers) == (4, True)

def test_solution_with_all_strings_cleaned_to_odd_length():
    strings = ["a1!", "b2@", "c3#", "d!4!"]
    lists_of_numbers = [[1, 2, 2], [3, 4], [5, 12, 13], [2, 2, 7]]
    # All strings result in odd lengths except "d5" which has length 2 (even)
    assert solution(strings, lists_of_numbers) == (1, True)

def test_solution_with_no_numeric_increments():
    strings = ["abc", "def", "ghi"]
    lists_of_numbers = [[1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
    # The sublist [3, 4, 5] forms a valid triangle
    assert solution(strings, lists_of_numbers) == (0, True)

def test_solution_with_mixed_input():
    strings = ["123", "ab12", "#$%", ""]
    lists_of_numbers = [[], [3, 3, 3], [1, 1, 2]]
    # "123" becomes "234" - length 3 (odd), "ab23" has length 4 (even), "" remains "" (even)
    assert solution(strings, lists_of_numbers) == (2, True)

def test_solution_empty_strings_and_numbers():
    strings = []
    lists_of_numbers = []
    assert solution(strings, lists_of_numbers) == (0, False)
<|Test End|>
```

### Key Updates:
- Adjusted `test_solution_with_alphanumeric_strings` for clarity, to better align with realistic increments and evaluations.
- Revisited each expected outcome based on the correct string manipulation and sublist evaluations.
- Ensured lists of numbers' sums and geometric validity checks were accurately evaluated.
