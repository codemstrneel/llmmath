QUESTION

Write a function that takes a pascal case string where each word represents a day of the week, converts it to a kebab case string, and then returns the days in a list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the ongoing issue, it appears there might be a confusion with how the solution and tests are formatted and submitted. Let's streamline the solution by correcting the format according to the required specification.

Here is the correct format without extraneous issues such as using incorrect markers within the code block:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(day_string):
    """
    Converts a PascalCase day string into a kebab-case list of the days.
    
    Parameters:
    day_string (str): PascalCase string of week days.

    Returns:
    list: List of kebab-case day strings.
    """
    import re
    # Use regex to split on each capital letter (not at the start) to create kebab-case
    kebab_string = re.sub(r'(?<!^)(?=[A-Z])', '-', day_string).lower()
    # Split the kebab-case string by '-' and filter out any empty strings
    return [day for day in kebab_string.split('-') if day]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_individual_days():
    assert solution("Monday") == ["monday"]
    assert solution("Tuesday") == ["tuesday"]
    assert solution("Wednesday") == ["wednesday"]
    assert solution("Thursday") == ["thursday"]
    assert solution("Friday") == ["friday"]
    assert solution("Saturday") == ["saturday"]
    assert solution("Sunday") == ["sunday"]

def test_combined_days():
    assert solution("MondayTuesdayWednesday") == ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday"]
    assert solution("ThursdayFriday") == ["thursday", "friday"]
    assert solution("SaturdaySundayMonday") == ["saturday", "sunday", "monday"]

def test_all_days():
    all_days = "MondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturdaySunday"
    expected = ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"]
    assert solution(all_days) == expected

def test_empty_string():
    assert solution("") == []

def test_invalid_input():
    # Test for some random PascalCase not matching the days
    invalid_str = "FundayWorkdayHoliday"
    expected_invalid = ["funday", "workday", "holiday"]
    assert solution(invalid_str) == expected_invalid
```
<|Test End|>

Here, we've ensured that:
1. The regex is appropriately used to transform PascalCase to kebab-case.
2. Unit tests cover valid day splits and handle possible empty string entries gracefully.
3. The tests do not attempt cases outside typical PascalCase conventions as described.
