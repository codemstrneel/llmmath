QUESTION

Create a Python function that calculates the product of all odd numbers within a specified range \( l \) to \( r \), inclusive. After obtaining this product, determine the remainder when divided by the perimeter of a rectangle. Create a helper function to calculate the rectangle's perimeter. Assume the input to the function includes five integers \( w, h, l, r, \) and a float \( p \), where \( w \) is the rectangle's width, \( h \) is its height, and \( p \) is a provided float point. The function must also return a Boolean indicating if \( p \) is greater than the rectangle's perimeter using other helper functions.
