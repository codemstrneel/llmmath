QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a sequence of integers. For each sequence, replace each integer with the first digit of its factorial and check if the resulting sequence forms a Fibonacci sequence. Use recursion to calculate the factorial of the numbers and ensure that the transformation is applied to each sequence using a map function. Return a list of indices of the dictionaries where the sequences fulfill the Fibonacci condition.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The compilation errors in the previous attempts are likely due to the syntax surrounding solution and test code blocks. Let's ensure the blocks are correctly formatted without any extra or missing characters to resolve these issues. I will reformat the sections carefully.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def factorial(n):
    "Recursively calculates the factorial of n."
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

def first_digit_of_factorial(n):
    "Calculates factorial and returns its first digit."
    fact = factorial(n)
    return int(str(fact)[0])

def is_fibonacci_sequence(seq):
    "Checks if a sequence is a Fibonacci sequence."
    if len(seq) < 2:
        return True
    if len(seq) == 2:
        return seq[0] == seq[1] or seq[1] == seq[0] + seq[1]
    for i in range(2, len(seq)):
        if seq[i] != seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2]:
            return False
    return True

def solution(dicts):
    """

    replaces each integer with the first digit of its factorial, 
    and checks if the resulting sequence forms a Fibonacci sequence.
    Returns a list of indices where the sequences fulfill the condition.
    """
    results = []
    
    for index, d in enumerate(dicts):
        for seq in d.values():
            transformed_seq = list(map(first_digit_of_factorial, seq))
            if is_fibonacci_sequence(transformed_seq):
                results.append(index)
                break
    
    return results

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_empty_sequence():
    dicts = [{'seq1': []}]
    assert solution(dicts) == []

def test_single_element_sequence():
    dicts = [{'seq1': [5]}, {'seq2': [7]}]

    # Both sequences can be considered as Fibonacci as the initial 1 can be part of Fibonacci sequences
    assert solution(dicts) == [0]

def test_simple_fibonacci():
    dicts = [{'seq1': [1, 1, 2]}, {'seq2': [3, 5, 8]}]
    # First one remains a simple Fibonacci, others are not after transformation
    assert solution(dicts) == [0]

def test_mixed_cases():
    dicts = [
        {'seq1': [1, 2, 2, 3]},  # Transforms to [1, 2, 2, 3] and is not Fibonacci
        {'seq2': [1, 1, 2, 3]},  # Already Fibonacci when starting sequence
        {'seq3': [1, 1, 2]}      # Already Fibonacci
    ]
    assert solution(dicts) == [1, 2]

def test_fibonacci_transformed():
    dicts = [
        {'seq1': [1, 1, 2]},    # Simple Fibonacci
        {'seq2': [3, 5, 8]},    # Doesn't hold true under factorial transformation rules
    ]
    assert solution(dicts) == [0]

def test_no_fibonacci_transformed():
    dicts = [
        {'seq1': [6, 7, 4]},   # Transforms to [7, 5, 2] and isn't Fibonacci
        {'seq2': [2, 9, 3]},   # Transforms to [2, 3, 6] and isn't Fibonacci
    ]
    assert solution(dicts) == []
```

This test suite covers various scenarios, including the transformation effects on small, single, double, and non-trivial sequences to effectively ensure the correctness of the `solution` function.
