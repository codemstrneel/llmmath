QUESTION

Write a function that, given a list of dictionaries and an integer n, returns the nth Fibonacci number and the dictionary with the maximum value for a specified key, where the key is the name of a Fibonacci number (e.g., 'Fibonacci_5').

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the syntax issues and update the solution and tests accordingly. 

1. Make sure the code is not mistakenly wrapped with triple quotes.
2. Verify that the Fibonacci calculation and the logic for identifying the max dictionary are correct.
3. Ensure the unit tests are accurate and correctly formatted using pytest.

We'll fix these aspects in the given solution.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Compute the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach.
    """
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

def solution(list_of_dicts, n):
    """
    Returns a tuple with the nth Fibonacci number and the dictionary with 
    the maximum value for the `Fibonacci_<n>` key.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n should be a non-negative integer")
    
    # Calculate nth Fibonacci number
    nth_fibonacci = fibonacci(n)
    
    # Determine the key to be used for finding maximum in dictionaries
    fib_key = f'Fibonacci_{n}'
    
    # Find the dictionary with the maximum value for the specified Fibonacci key
    max_dict = None
    max_value = float('-inf')
    for d in list_of_dicts:
        if fib_key in d and d[fib_key] > max_value:
            max_value = d[fib_key]
            max_dict = d
    
    return nth_fibonacci, max_dict
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_basic():
    dicts = [
        {'Fibonacci_5': 5},
        {'Fibonacci_5': 3},
        {'Fibonacci_5': 1}  # Largest value is 5
    ]
    nth_fib, max_dict = solution(dicts, 5)
    assert nth_fib == 5  # The 5th Fibonacci number is 5
    assert max_dict == {'Fibonacci_5': 5}

def test_solution_no_key():
    dicts = [
        {'Fibonacci_2': 8},
        {'Fibonacci_5': 7}
    ]
    nth_fib, max_dict = solution(dicts, 10)
    assert nth_fib == 55  # The 10th Fibonacci number is 55
    assert max_dict == None  # Since 'Fibonacci_10' key does not exist in any dict

def test_solution_empty_list():
    nth_fib, max_dict = solution([], 8)
    assert nth_fib == 21  # The 8th Fibonacci number is 21
    assert max_dict == None  # No dictionary available

def test_solution_negative():
    try:
        solution([], -1)
    except ValueError:
        assert True
    else:
        assert False

def test_solution_single_element():
    dicts = [
        {'Fibonacci_3': 2},
    ]
    nth_fib, max_dict = solution(dicts, 3)
    assert nth_fib == 2  # The 3rd Fibonacci number is 2
    assert max_dict == {'Fibonacci_3': 2}

def test_solution_no_matching_key():
    dicts = [
        {'Fibonacci_8': 20},
        {'Fibonacci_9': 34}
    ]
    nth_fib, max_dict = solution(dicts, 7)
    assert nth_fib == 13  # The 7th Fibonacci number is 13
    assert max_dict == None  # Since 'Fibonacci_7' key does not exist in any dict
```
<|Test End|>

This time, the code should compile correctly and execute the tests properly, confirming the solution logic and correctness.
