QUESTION

Write a python function to calculate the sum of the first n odd natural numbers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Here is the solution to calculate the sum of the first n odd natural numbers, along with the corresponding unit tests.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n):
    """
    Returns the sum of the first n odd natural numbers.
    An odd natural number sequence is: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
    The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n^2.
    """
    return n * n
<|Solution End|>
```

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_sum_of_first_n_odd_numbers():
    assert solution(1) == 1  # The first odd number is 1
    assert solution(2) == 4  # 1 + 3 = 4
    assert solution(3) == 9  # 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
    assert solution(4) == 16 # 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
    assert solution(5) == 25 # 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25

def test_zero_and_negative():
    assert solution(0) == 0  # Sum of zero odd numbers is 0
    assert solution(-1) == 0 # For negative n, sum should be 0

def test_large_n():
    assert solution(100) == 10000  # 100^2 = 10000
<|Test End|>
```
