QUESTION

Write a Python function that analyzes and transforms a mixed data structure containing both numeric and text components. The function should take a list of floating-point numbers (which might represent measurements or data points) and a paragraph of text. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify and return all sublists from the list of floating-point numbers where consecutive numbers differ by a value greater than a specified threshold (this is similar to detecting anomalies or transitions).

2. Count and return the number of sentences in the text that contain an odd number of words.

3. Calculate the median of each identified floating-point sublist and determine the list position where this median value could be inserted into a separately provided sorted array, without altering that array.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- A list of identified anomalous floating-point sublists.
- The count of sentences with an odd number of words.
- A list of positions for inserting each median into the given sorted array, maintaining its order. 

This problem requires an integration of numeric data analysis and text processing, involving floating-point arithmetic, sequence pattern recognition, text segmentation, and median calculation.
