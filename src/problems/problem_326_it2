QUESTION

Write a Python function to check whether the given number is a perfect square or not, and verify if the next perfect square (if any) is a prime number.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues with the test cases and the understanding of the problem statement. The function needs to verify if a number is a perfect square, and if so, it must check whether the next perfect square is prime, which was incorrectly understood in the test cases. Let's correct and implement accurate tests.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import math

def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a given number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def solution(n):
    """
    Check if n is a perfect square, and if so, check if the next
    perfect square is a prime number.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    if root * root == n:  # n is a perfect square
        next_perfect_square = (root + 1) ** 2
        return is_prime(next_perfect_square)
    return False
<|Solution End|>
```

**Revised Test Cases**

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_perfect_square_next_is_prime():
    # 9 -> next is 16, not prime
    assert not solution(9)  
    # 4 -> next is 9, not prime
    assert not solution(4)  
    # 16 -> next is 25, not prime
    assert not solution(16) 

def test_not_perfect_square():
    assert not solution(2)
    assert not solution(3)
    assert not solution(5)
    assert not solution(7)
    assert not solution(10)

def test_large_perfect_square():
    # 1000000 is 1000^2, next perfect square is 1002001 which is not prime.
    assert not solution(1_000_000)

def test_negative_and_edge_cases():
    assert not solution(-4)  # Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares
    assert not solution(0)   # 0 is a perfect square, next is 1 and not prime
    assert not solution(-1)  # Negative number case

def test_specific_cases():
    assert not solution(36)  # 36 -> next is 49, 7^2 (not prime)
    assert not solution(49)  # 49 -> next is 64, 8^2 (not prime)
    assert not solution(81)  # 81 -> next is 100, 10^2 (not prime)
<|Test End|>
```

Our test coverage has been improved to accurately reflect the problem conditions, with correct expectations regarding whether the next perfect square of a perfect square number is a prime number or not. This set should now work correctly under the function's given logic.
