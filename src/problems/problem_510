QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes an integer \( n \) and returns a tuple containing two elements:

1. The sum of the fifth powers of all natural numbers up to \( n \).
2. A new integer generated by left rotating the bits of this sum by three positions, and then finding a number in the rotated result that appears an odd number of times.

To accomplish the task, implement the following steps:

- Calculate the sum of the fifth powers of all natural numbers up to the given number \( n \).
- Convert this sum into its binary representation, left-rotate the bits by three positions.
- From the resulting integer (after the bit rotation), identify all unique digits.
- Find which unique digit occurs an odd number of times in this rotated binary number.
- Return a tuple with the sum and the identified digit that occurs an odd number of times. If no such digit exists, return a predetermined error value (e.g., -1).

Ensure the function properly handles various edge cases, including small and large values of \( n \) and scenarios where no digit occurs an odd number of times after the rotation.

SOL & TESTS

```python
def sum_fifth_powers_and_odd_digit(n):
    if n < 1:
        return (0, -1)

    # Step 1: Calculate the sum of the fifth powers
    power_sum = sum(k ** 5 for k in range(1, n + 1))

    # Step 2: Convert the sum into its binary representation and left rotate by 3 bits
    bin_representation = bin(power_sum)[2:]  # Strip the '0b' prefix
    shifted = bin_representation[3:] + bin_representation[:3]

    # Convert shifted binary string back to integer
    rotated_value = int(shifted, 2)

    # Step 3: Check digits in binary form of rotated_value to find one that appears an odd number of times
    digit_count = {}
    for digit in str(rotated_value):
        digit_count[digit] = digit_count.get(digit, 0) + 1

    # Check for a digit that occurs an odd number of times
    for digit in digit_count:
        if digit_count[digit] % 2 != 0:
            return (power_sum, int(digit))

    # Return error value if no odd occurrence is found
    return (power_sum, -1)
```
