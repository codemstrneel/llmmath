QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a string representing time in 24-hour format (HH:MM) and returns a new string where non-zero elements of the hours are shifted one position to the right and then converted to 12-hour format with AM/PM designation.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The existing solution contains a logical error in the way it handles and converts hours to the 12-hour format, specifically in the transition from 24-hour to 12-hour periods and positions of digits. It currently does not correctly address the AM/PM conversion after shifting the digits of the hours. Let's fix the solution and ensure our unit tests reflect various edge cases.

Here's the corrected solution along with refined unit tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(time_str):
    """
    Converts a 24-hour time format string into a 12-hour format time string with a shifted hour digit.
    """
    # Split the time into hours and minutes
    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))

    # Shift the hour digit if hours are non-zero and have more than one digit
    if hours > 0 and hours > 9:
        hours_str = str(hours)
        shifted_hours_str = hours_str[-1] + hours_str[:-1]
        shifted_hours = int(shifted_hours_str)
    else:
        shifted_hours = hours

    # Convert to 12-hour format
    if shifted_hours == 0:
        period = "AM"
        converted_hours = 12
    elif 1 <= shifted_hours < 12:
        period = "AM"
        converted_hours = shifted_hours
    elif shifted_hours == 12:
        period = "PM"
        converted_hours = 12
    else:
        period = "PM"
        converted_hours = shifted_hours - 12

    # Format the new time string
    new_time_str = f"{converted_hours}:{minutes:02d} {period}"

    return new_time_str

<|Test End|>

This revised code should operate correctly, handling AM/PM conversion with proper hour shifting and expanded test coverage for boundary and transition scenarios.
