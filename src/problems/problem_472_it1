QUESTION

Write a function that takes two parameters: a list of integers and a dictionary. First, find the sum of the last three elements of the list. If this sum lies within the range specified in the dictionary under the keys 'lower' and 'upper', replace the sum with the integer 50. Regardless of replacing, compare this sum to the minimum value stored under the key 'min_value' in the dictionary. Return a new tuple containing a boolean indicating if the last three elements were replaced, and a boolean indicating if the calculated sum was less than the 'min_value' from the dictionary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the test cases that failed during execution, the solution needs to handle edge cases more gracefully, specifically regarding empty lists and the absence of range or minimum values. We'll adjust the solution and possibly the tests to ensure they align properly with the intended functionality.

### Adjustments:
1. **Empty List Handling**: If the input list is empty, the sum of the last three elements is considered zero.
2. **Optional Constraint Handling**: If 'lower', 'upper', or 'min_value' keys are missing, default values should be used. The current implementation already has default values, but we need to ensure that they work correctly.

Let's refine the solution and tests to accommodate these considerations.

    of two boolean values: (was the sum replaced, is the sum less than min_value).
