QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a square matrix filled with the first n perfect squares of the sum of products of all possible contiguous subarrays, arranged in spiral order. After constructing the matrix, determine if the matrix, as read in a spiral order, forms a valid monotonic sequence.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems that in Attempt 2, there was a misunderstanding regarding the problem requirements and some assumptions about the solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem and ensure the solution is checked for correctness. Additionally, I'll update the tests accordingly.

The task is to calculate the SOPCS, form a matrix from the perfect squares, fill it in a spiral order, and check whether it forms a monotonic sequence.

Let's redefine the solution function and the tests based on the specified requirements:

These tests will check both correctness and error handling for input sizes that aren't perfect squares.
