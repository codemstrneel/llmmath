QUESTION

Create a Python function that calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given non-negative integer.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems like there was a formatting issue in the previous attempts. Let's make sure that the solution and tests are formatted correctly according to the output format specified. I'll provide a corrected version below.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n):
    """
    Returns the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given non-negative integer n.
    This sum is equal to 2^n.
    """
    return 2 ** n
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_zero():
    assert solution(0) == 1

def test_solution_single_coefficient():
    assert solution(1) == 2

def test_solution_multiple_coefficients():
    assert solution(2) == 4
    assert solution(3) == 8
    assert solution(4) == 16
    assert solution(5) == 32

def test_solution_large_numbers():
    assert solution(10) == 1024
    assert solution(20) == 1048576
    assert solution(30) == 1073741824

def test_solution_extremely_large_number():
    # An extremely large number to test the function's ability to handle it
    assert solution(50) == 1125899906842624
    assert solution(100) == 1267650600228229401496703205376
```
<|Test End|>

These tests now reflect the requirement to verify the solution method of calculating the sum of binomial coefficients as \(2^n\) across a range of values, ensuring robustness and correctness.
