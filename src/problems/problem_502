QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of URLs as input and performs the following tasks for each URL:

1. Extract the year, month, day, and hour using regex and validate these values to ensure they represent a real date and time. If the date and time are valid, proceed to the next step; otherwise, skip the URL.

2. Count the alphabets, digits, and special characters in the entire URL string. Identify the most frequently occurring character overall.

3. Use regex to compress any sequence of multiple spaces into a single space within the URL.

4. Group and join URLs into tuples if they have the same year and month extracted in step 1.

5. Return a dictionary where each key is a tuple of year and month, and the value is a list of URLs that belong to that tuple, along with the character frequencies obtained in step 2 for each URL.

This problem combines elements of date extraction and validation with regex, character counting and frequency analysis, space compression with regex, and grouping based on extracted values.
