QUESTION

Write a function that takes two strings and a tuple as inputs. First, check if the characters of the first string can rearrange to form the second string. If they can, rotate the second string to the left by the length of the input tuple. Then, check if all elements of the tuple are present in the rotated string as ASCII character values. If they are, return a new string formed by concatenating the characters from both input strings that correspond to 'prime positions' (indices which are prime numbers) after rotation. If any condition fails, return an empty string.

SOLUTION/TESTS

After reviewing the previous code and tests, let's refactor the solution and ensure the tests are correctly aligned with the objectives. We need to ensure that the characters of the first string can form an anagram of the second string, rotate the string, verify ASCII character values in the tuple, and gather characters at prime positions. Hereâ€™s a corrected implementation:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(s1, s2, tpl):
    from collections import Counter
    
    def is_anagram(s1, s2):
        return Counter(s1) == Counter(s2)

    def rotate_string(s, n):
        return s[n:] + s[:n]

    def is_prime(num):
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        if num <= 3:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= num:
            if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    if not is_anagram(s1, s2):
        return ""
    
    rotated_s2 = rotate_string(s2, len(tpl))
    
    if not all(chr(el) in rotated_s2 for el in tpl):
        return ""
    
    def prime_index_chars(s):
        return [s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if is_prime(i)]

    prime_chars_s1 = prime_index_chars(s1)
    prime_chars_s2 = prime_index_chars(rotated_s2)
    
    return ''.join(prime_chars_s1 + prime_chars_s2)
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_anagram_and_tuple_check():
    assert solution("abc", "bac", (98, 97, 99)) == "bbc"  # "abc" rotates to "bac", prime indices in "abc" are [1, 2] -> 'b', 'c', and rotated "bac" also [1, 2] -> 'b', 'c'
    assert solution("abc", "bca", (98, 97)) == "bca"  # "bca" rotates to "cab", prime indices in "abc" are [1, 2] -> 'b', 'c', and rotated "cab" [1, 2] -> 'a', 'b'

def test_solution_no_anagram():
    assert solution("abcd", "abcdabc", (65, 98, 99)) == ""  # 'abcd' cannot be rearranged to form 'abcdabc'
    assert solution("abc", "def", (100, 101, 102)) == ""  # Different strings

def test_solution_no_tuple_in_string():
    assert solution("abc", "bac", (120, 121, 122)) == ""  # ASCII values (120, 121, 122) correspond to 'x', 'y', 'z'; none appear in "bac"
    assert solution("abcd", "bcda", (120,)) == ""  # 'x' not present in any rotation of "abcd"

def test_solution_empty_string_and_tuple_case():
    assert solution("", "", tuple()) == ""  # Both strings empty, no prime indices
    assert solution("a", "a", tuple()) == ""  # No prime indices in single character string
```
<|Test End|>

Key adjustments:

- Ensure the understanding of prime indices and how they affect both strings.
- Ensure tuple element checks for both presence as ASCII values and their implication on logic.
- Improve the clarity and comprehensiveness of the test cases to edge conditions.
