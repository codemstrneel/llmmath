QUESTION

Here is a novel question that combines elements from the given questions:

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that processes a list of strings in the following way:

1. For each string in the list, split the string into individual words.
2. For each word, count the number of digits, alphabets, and special characters.
3. Generate and return a dictionary where each word is a key and the value is a tuple containing:
   - The count of alphabets,
   - The count of digits,
   - The count of special characters.
4. Finally, evaluate if the total count of all digits in all words combined can be distributed into three separate non-zero groups such that they can represent possible side lengths of a valid triangle.

The function should return a dictionary as described in step 3 and a boolean indicating whether the total digit count can form the sides of a valid triangle.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def word_analysis_and_triangle_check(strings: list) -> (dict, bool):
    pass
```

**Constraints:**
- A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
- Special characters are defined as any characters not classified as alphabets or digits.

            word_info[word] = (alphabets, digits, special_chars)
            total_digits += digits

                c = total_digits - a - b
                if c > 0 and a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
