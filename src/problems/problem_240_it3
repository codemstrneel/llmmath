QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and a positive integer `n` as input. The function should first move all zeroes to the end of the list while preserving the order of non-zero elements. Then, it should perform a left rotation of the bits of each non-zero integer in the list by `n` positions. If the list contains only zeroes, return the list as-is.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the test failures by ensuring our solution logic and test cases align correctly. The following adjustments will be applied:

- The `left_rotate_bits` function should correctly handle the rotation of bits in the context of a fixed-width, 32-bit integer.

- Ensure all test cases accurately reflect expected outputs given the requirements of bit rotatation and order of non-zero elements, followed by zeroes.

Here's the revised solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(numbers, n):
    def left_rotate_bits(num, n):
        # Assuming a standard of 32 bits for bitwise rotation.
        num_bits = 32
        # Left rotate the bits of num by n positions
        n %= num_bits  # Ensure the rotation wraps around 32 bits
        return ((num << n) | (num >> (num_bits - n))) & ((1 << num_bits) - 1)

    # Separate non-zero and zero elements
    non_zeroes = [num for num in numbers if num != 0]
    zeroes = [num for num in numbers if num == 0]

    # Perform the bitwise rotation on non-zero elements
    rotated_non_zeroes = [left_rotate_bits(num, n) for num in non_zeroes]

    # Combine the non-zero elements followed by zeroes
    return rotated_non_zeroes + zeroes
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_no_zeroes():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 1) == [2, 4, 6]

def test_all_zeroes():
    assert solution([0, 0, 0], 3) == [0, 0, 0]

def test_mixed_zeroes():
    assert solution([0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2], 2) == [4, 12, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

def test_no_rotation():
    assert solution([4, 1], 0) == [4, 1]

def test_large_rotation():
    # In a full 32-bit rotation, the number should return to its original form
    assert solution([1, 3, 7], 32) == [1, 3, 7]

def test_single_element():
    assert solution([9], 1) == [18]

def test_single_zero():
    assert solution([0], 5) == [0]

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 3) == []

def test_fixed_rotation_edge_case():
    # Test some edge cases with known bit rotations
    assert solution([15, 8, 255], 4) == [240, 128, 4080]
<|Test End|>

This solution continues to use 32-bit rotation logic with tests that reflect expected outcomes based on that logic. The test for "large_rotation" checks that if the rotation amount is a multiple of 32, the number remains unchanged. Adjust the expectation of `15, 8, 255` on `test_fixed_rotation_edge_case` to match proper bit rotation results.
