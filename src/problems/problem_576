QUESTION

Create a Python function that first calculates the sum of all odd numbers within a specified range \( l \) to \( r \), inclusive. Then, take this sum and find its remainder when divided by a given trapezium's area, for which you will also write a helper function. Additionally, check if the specified range \( l \) to \( r \) forms an arithmetic progression and calculate its common difference. If the progression exists and is non-zero, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the common difference and the sum of odd numbers. Finally, multiply this GCD with the remainder from the first computation and return the result. Consider the input to the function as five integers \( a, b, h, l, \) and \( r \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and \( h \) is the height of the trapezium.
