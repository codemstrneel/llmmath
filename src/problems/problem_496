QUESTION

Here's a new coding question that combines concepts from Question 2 and Question 3 in a unique way:

### Novel Question:

Write a Python function that takes a string `s` and a list of dates, each in the format `"YYYY-MM-DD"`. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each date, extract the numeric month (`m`) and day (`d`) components.
2. For each string, compute the difference in days between the given date and August 31 of the same year. If the day component (`d`) is less than or equal to `31`, then the difference is \(31 - d\). Otherwise, use a predefined value of 31.
3. Based on the difference from step 2, determine the number of consonants in the given string `s`. If `s` has fewer consonants than the computed difference, set the difference to the number of consonants in `s`.
4. Construct a list of integers representing this adjusted "consonant difference".
5. For the constructed list, find the longest contiguous sub-sequence where the elements form consecutive integers.
6. Return a dictionary with keys:
   - `"date_diff"`: A list with the computed difference for each date.
   - `"adjusted_consonant_list"`: The list of integers representing the adjusted consonant difference.
   - `"max_consecutive_subsequence"`: The length of the longest sub-sequence of consecutive integers.

### Example:

Given the string `"hello world"` and the list of dates `["2023-08-10", "2023-09-05"]`:

1. The date differences are:
   - August 10, 2023: 31 - 10 = 21 (adjusted to `5` because "hello world" has `5` consonants)
   - September 5, 2023: September has `30` days, so 30 - 5 = 25

2. The `"adjusted_consonant_list"` would be `[5, 5]`, as "hello world" only has 5 consonants.

3. The longest contiguous sub-sequence of consecutive integers from `[5, 5]` is `1` (as both parts are isolated `5`s).

So, the function would return:
```python
{
  "date_diff": [21, 25],
  "adjusted_consonant_list": [5, 5],
  "max_consecutive_subsequence": 1
}
```

### Constraints:

1. The string `s` will only contain alphabetical characters and spaces.
2. Each date is guaranteed to be in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format and valid.
