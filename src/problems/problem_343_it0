QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a sequence of integers. For each sequence, replace each integer with the first digit of its factorial and check if the resulting sequence forms a Fibonacci sequence. Use recursion to calculate the factorial of the numbers and ensure that the transformation is applied to each sequence using a map function. Return a list of indices of the dictionaries where the sequences fulfill the Fibonacci condition.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve the problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Factorial Computation:** Use recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.
2. **Transformation:** For each number in a sequence, replace it with the first digit of its factorial.
3. **Fibonacci Check:** Determine if the resulting sequence forms a Fibonacci sequence.
4. **Mapping and Filtering:** Apply the transformation and Fibonacci check to each sequence in the list of dictionaries.
5. **Return Indices:** Return the indices of sequences that satisfy the Fibonacci condition.

Here's the solution, including the detailed steps:

```python
def factorial(n):
    "Recursively calculates the factorial of n."
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

def first_digit_of_factorial(n):
    "Calculates factorial and returns its first digit."
    fact = factorial(n)
    return int(str(fact)[0])

def is_fibonacci_sequence(seq):
    "Checks if a sequence is a Fibonacci sequence."
    if len(seq) < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(seq)):
        if seq[i] != seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2]:
            return False
    return True
