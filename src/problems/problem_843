QUESTION

### New Problem:

Design a function that simulates a transportation hub's scheduling system where various transport services can operate concurrently on different channels. The function should process a comprehensive input including a string depicting a timetable with intermingled text for services and times, alongside a list of integer intervals representing available time slots.

### Requirements:

1. **Regex Parsing:** Use regular expressions to extract information from the timetable string. The timetable string includes various transport services denoted by words and their times by numbers. The organization might include services such as "bus", "train", and "flight", with each having specific departure and arrival times.

2. **Channel Allocation:** Assign services to available time slots across different channels, ensuring that overlapping services are not assigned to the same channel. The objective is to determine the fewest number of channels required to operate all services within the provided time slots.

3. **Service Selection:** Implement logic to determine which services can begin within a given time slot. If multiple services can start at the same time, and separate channels cannot be allocated, prioritize based on a secondary criterion like alphabetical order or duration.

4. **String Transformation:** Incorporate a rule that if the concatenated names of services on a single channel exceed a certain length, those names should be divided into substrings at vowel boundaries via regex, ensuring each substring is at least two characters long.

5. **Output Format:** Return a tuple containing:
   - The minimum number of channels needed.
   - A list of channels, each indicating its scheduled services and their times.
   - A modified list of service names separated based on the rule.

### Input:

- A timetable string, e.g., "06busDeparture 09trainArrival 12flightDeparture".
- A list of permissible time slots, e.g., [6, 9, 12, 15].
- An integer `m` specifying the character length constraint for service name concatenation necessitating separation.

### Example Call:

```python
schedule_transports("06busDeparture 09trainArrival 12flightDeparture", [6, 9, 12, 15], 15)
```

### Expected Output Format:

The output might look like this:

```python
(2, 
 [
  {"time_slot": 6, "services": ["Bus"]}, 
  {"time_slot": 9, "services": ["Train", "Flight"]}
 ], 
 ["Bu-sDe-parture", "Trai-nAr-rival", "Fl-ightD-eparture"]
)
```

This problem involves similar principles such as parsing with regex, channel allocation (akin to platform assignment), handling complex conditions for string manipulations, and ensuring optimal resource usage through efficient scheduling.
