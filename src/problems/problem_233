QUESTION

**Integrative Coding Question:**

Create a Python function that combines string processing, arithmetic operations, and tuple filtering. The function should accept two parameters: a string and a list of tuples. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Trim leading and trailing spaces from the string.
2. Replace each sequence of digits in the string with its corresponding English word representation.
3. Group words in the string by their starting letter (case-insensitive).
4. For each group of words, count how many words have more than 5 letters.

Simultaneously, process the list of tuples by:
1. Removing tuples that contain a `None` or where any integer in the tuple is prime.
2. For each remaining tuple, check if the difference between the largest and smallest integer is exactly 4.

Finally, return a dictionary with two keys:
- `'processed_word_groups'`: a dictionary where the keys are the starting letters of the words in the string (in lowercase), and the values are the count of words with more than 5 letters in that group.
- `'filtered_tuples'`: a list of tuples that remain after removing those with `None` or prime integers, which have exactly a difference of 4 between the largest and smallest integers.

For example, given the string `"  apple 12 banana 34 exert elephant  "` and the list of tuples `[(1, 5, 9), (6, None), (10, 14), (13, 17, 19)]`, the output should be:

```python
{
    'processed_word_groups': {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'e': 2},
    'filtered_tuples': [(10, 14)]
}
```

In this example:
- The string transformation results in the words being grouped by starting letter, and counts words with more than 5 letters in each group.
- The tuple (1, 5, 9) is removed due to containing a prime number (5), (6, None) is removed due to `None`, and (13, 17, 19) is removed due to all numbers being prime. Only (10, 14) remains because the difference between 14 and 10 is exactly 4.
