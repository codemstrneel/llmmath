QUESTION

Write a Python function to find all prime numbers in a mixed list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

## Solution

To solve the problem of finding all prime numbers in a mixed list, we first need to define what a prime number is: a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. We will implement a helper function to check if a number is prime and then apply this function to each element in the list, filtering out the prime numbers.

Below is the Python function and accompanying unit tests.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Helper function to determine if a number is prime.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def solution(mixed_list):
    """
    Returns a list of all prime numbers contained in the input mixed_list.
    """
    return [x for x in mixed_list if isinstance(x, int) and is_prime(x)]
<|Solution End|>
```

## Unit Tests

The tests will ensure that our solution handles typical cases, edge cases, and ignores non-integer inputs. We'll use `pytest` for our testing framework, which is a common choice for Python testing.

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_all_primes():
    assert solution([2, 3, 5, 7]) == [2, 3, 5, 7]

def test_no_primes():
    assert solution([4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12]) == []

def test_mixed_numbers():
    assert solution([11, 15, 23, 42, 29]) == [11, 23, 29]

def test_including_non_integers():
    assert solution([2, 3.5, '5', 13, True, None]) == [2, 13]

def test_negative_numbers():
    assert solution([-3, -2, 0, 1]) == []

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([]) == []

def test_edge_cases():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2]) == [2]
<|Test End|>
```

These tests cover various scenarios: lists full of primes, lists without primes, mixed data types, negative numbers, and edge inputs like empty lists or very small numbers.
