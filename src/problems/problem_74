QUESTION

**Problem Statement:** 

Create a Python function that integrates basic trend detection in a list of floats and simple character analysis in a given sentence. The function should take a list of floating-point numbers and a string sentence as input.

The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify and return all subsequences in the list of floats where each subsequent number is greater than the previous one by at least 0.5.

2. Count the number of vowels in the string sentence.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- A list of identified subsequences with each number being at least 0.5 greater than the previous one.
- The total count of vowels in the sentence.

This problem involves recognizing simple numeric trends and basic character counting, providing an integrated approach to both numeric and textual data analysis.
