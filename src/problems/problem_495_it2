QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a mixed list of integers and strings and returns a list of values extracted as follows: 

1. Check if each integer is a perfect square.
2. Extract strings that appear within quotation marks using regex.

The function should return a list of results consisting of boolean values indicating whether each integer is a perfect square and a list of extracted strings from the quoted sections. If an element doesn't fit either category, it should be ignored in the output.

For example, given the input list `[16, 'She said, "hello"', "Test 'this'", 5, '8']`, the function should return `[True, ['hello']]`.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there was a misunderstanding in formatting the expected outputs for the given problem. Let me address these issues and refine both the solution and the unit tests to align with the desired outputs.

The expected output format should consist of:
1. A list of boolean values indicating whether each integer is a perfect square, excluding cases that aren't integers.
2. A list of strings extracted using regex from quoted sections.

Let's make these changes:

<|Solution Begin|>
import re
import math
from typing import List, Union

def solution(mixed_list: List[Union[int, str]]) -> List[Union[bool, List[str]]]:
    # Initialize a list for booleans indicating perfect squares
    perfect_squares = []
    
    # Initialize a list for the extracted strings
    extracted_strings = []

    for item in mixed_list:
        if isinstance(item, int):
            # Check if the number is a perfect square and add to the list
            perfect_squares.append(is_perfect_square(item))
        elif isinstance(item, str):
            # Extract quoted strings using regex and extend the extracted_strings list
            quotes = re.findall(r'["\'](.*?)["\']', item)
            extracted_strings.extend(quotes)
    
    # Always return a boolean list concatenated with a single prompt with extracted strings
    return perfect_squares + [extracted_strings]

def is_perfect_square(number: int) -> bool:
    if number < 0:
        return False
    sqrt = math.isqrt(number)
    return sqrt * sqrt == number
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_mixed_list_with_perfect_squares_and_strings():
    assert solution([16, 'She said, "hello"', "Test 'this'", 5, '8']) == [True, ['hello', 'this']]

def test_if_no_strings_no_perfect_squares():
    assert solution([2, 3, 'Not "quoted"', 10]) == [False, False, False, []]

def test_only_strings_with_quotes():
    assert solution(['"Quoted"', "'also'", 'Normal']) == [[], ['Quoted', 'also']]

def test_no_strings_no_integers():
    assert solution([[], {}, ()]) == [[]]

def test_all_input_types_with_perfect_squares():
    assert solution([1, 4, 9, 16, 'Test', 'Say "hi"', 'Nothing here']) == [True, True, True, True, ['hi']]

def test_empty_string_and_zero():
    assert solution(['', 0]) == [True, []]

def test_negative_numbers():
    assert solution([-1, -4, -9, '"Negative"']) == [False, False, False, ['Negative']]
<|Test End|>

These modifications should make the solution and tests consistent with the desired output format, ensuring an accurate execution.
