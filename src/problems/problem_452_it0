QUESTION

Write a function that generates a square matrix filled with the maximum products of pairs formed by elements from a given array of integers. Arrange the products in ascending spiral order starting from the top-left corner of the matrix. If the length of the array isn't sufficient to form a complete square matrix, pad the remaining elements of the matrix with zeroes.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to create a square matrix populated with the products of all unique pairs formed by elements from the given array. Once these products are available, the task involves arranging them in ascending order and placing them in the matrix in a spiral order.

To clear the steps:
1. Generate all unique pair products.
2. Determine the size of the square matrix `n x n` such that `n^2` is at least equal to the number of unique products.
3. Place the products in a matrix in ascending spiral order.
4. If necessary, pad the remaining cells with zeroes if the products don't completely fill the matrix.

We'll implement the solution according to these steps and then write unit tests to validate the implementation.

```python
def solution(arr):
    from itertools import combinations
    
    # Step 1: Find all unique products from pairs
    products = set()
    for a, b in combinations(arr, 2):
        products.add(a * b)
    
    # Step 2: Sort products
    sorted_products = sorted(products)
    
    # Step 3: Determine the matrix size
    import math
    n = math.ceil(math.sqrt(len(sorted_products)))
    
    # Step 4: Initialize the matrix with zeros
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Step 5: Fill the matrix in spiral order
    k = 0  # index for sorted_products
    top, bottom = 0, n - 1
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    
    while k < len(sorted_products):
        # Fill top row
        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            if k < len(sorted_products):
                matrix[top][i] = sorted_products[k]
                k += 1
        top += 1
        
        # Fill right column
        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
            if k < len(sorted_products):
                matrix[i][right] = sorted_products[k]
                k += 1
        right -= 1
        
        # Fill bottom row
        if top <= bottom:
            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):
                if k < len(sorted_products):
                    matrix[bottom][i] = sorted_products[k]
                    k += 1
            bottom -= 1
        
        # Fill left column
        if left <= right:
            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):
                if k < len(sorted_products):
                    matrix[i][left] = sorted_products[k]
                    k += 1
            left += 1
