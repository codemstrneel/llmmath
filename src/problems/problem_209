QUESTION

Here's a new coding question that combines core concepts from the provided set of questions:

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of integers and a positive integer `k`. The task is to do the following:

1. Organize the integers into groups based on their remainder when divided by `k`.
2. For each group, calculate the number of integers and determine whether this count is even or odd.
3. Within each group, find the perimeter of a rectangle that can be formed with two sides being equal to the count of numbers in the group and the remainder itself.
4. Return a dictionary where the keys are the remainders, and the values are tuples containing:
   - 'even' or 'odd' based on the count of integers in that group.
   - The calculated perimeter of the rectangle for that group.

For example, given the input list `[5, 12, 14, 6, 9, 12]` and `k = 4`, the output should be: `{1: ('odd', 6), 0: ('even', 16), 2: ('even', 10)}`, where:
- For remainder 1: integers [5, 9] -> count is 2 (even), perimeter is 2*1 + 2*2 = 6
- For remainder 0: integers [12, 12] -> count is 2 (even), perimeter is 2*0 + 2*2 = 16
- For remainder 2: integers [14, 6] -> count is 2 (even), perimeter is 2*2 + 2*2 = 10
