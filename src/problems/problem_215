QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of tuples and a positive integer `k` as inputs. Each tuple contains three elements â€” two integers and a list of strings. The task is to perform the following:

1. Sort the tuples into groups based on the remainder when the second integer element of each tuple is divided by `k`.
2. For each group, calculate the number of tuples which have at least one string that contains a sequence of repeated characters of length two or more.
3. Within each group, calculate the maximum sum of the first integer element and the maximum length of strings (across all tuples in the group).
4. Return a dictionary where the keys are the remainders, and the values are tuples containing:
   - The count of tuples with at least one string containing a repeated character sequence.
   - The maximum sum of the first integer element and the maximum string length in that group.

For example, given the input list of tuples `[(5, 10, ['hello', 'world']), (3, 6, ['aa', 'bell']), (7, 10, ['tree']), (1, 3, ['goal'])]` and `k = 5`, the output should be structured in such a way that each key is a remainder, and each value is a tuple indicating the count and maximum sum as described above.

This combines the concepts of grouping by remainder, identifying patterns in lists, and calculating maximum values from multiple attributes within each group.
