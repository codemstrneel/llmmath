QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a sorted list where one element is an extra and a single integer representing the target index of a factorial number. The function should return a tuple containing two values: the index of the extra element in the list and the first digit of the factorial of the given integer. Combine iterative and recursive approaches in your solution.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Thank you for your patience. Letâ€™s address the syntax issue and refine the solution and the corresponding unit tests appropriately to ensure they work correctly. The goal is to identify where the extra element disrupts the sorted order and to accurately compute and return the first digit of the factorial of a given target number.

Here's the corrected implementation:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(sorted_list, target):
    # Find the index of the extra element in the sorted list
    def find_extra_element_index(sorted_list):
        for i in range(len(sorted_list) - 1):
            if sorted_list[i + 1] != sorted_list[i] + 1:
                return i + 1
        return len(sorted_list) - 1  # In case the extra element is at the end
    
    # Recursive function to calculate factorial
    def factorial_recursive(n):
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
    
    # Calculate the first digit of factorial number
    def first_digit_of_factorial(n):
        fact = factorial_recursive(n)
        return int(str(fact)[0])
    
    extra_element_index = find_extra_element_index(sorted_list)
    first_digit = first_digit_of_factorial(target)
    
    return (extra_element_index, first_digit)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_extra_in_middle():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6], 5) == (3, 1), "Failed on test with extra in the middle"

def test_solution_extra_at_start():
    assert solution([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == (1, 2), "Failed on test with extra at start"

def test_solution_extra_at_end():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8], 3) == (7, 6), "Failed on test with extra at end"

def test_solution_extra_in_large_list():
    sorted_list = list(range(101))  # This includes 0 to 100
    assert solution(sorted_list[:50] + [50] + sorted_list[50:], 10) == (50, 3), "Failed on test with large list"

def test_solution_factorial_large_n():
    # For 9!, the factorial is 362880, so the first digit is 3
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 3, 5], 9) == (4, 3), "Failed on test with large factorial number"
    
def test_solution_extra_at_start_large_target():
    # For 15!, the factorial starts with 1
    assert solution([0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 15) == (2, 1), "Failed on test with extra at start and large target"
<|Test End|>

These corrections should yield the desired testing outcomes. The revised unit tests are implementation-independent, as they verify the function's output rather than its internal working.
