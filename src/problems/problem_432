QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes in the following two arguments:
1. A string containing multiple sentences.
2. A list of integers.

The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify all unique words in the text and determine the number of words that are most frequently followed by a vowel in any of the sentences.
2. From the list of integers, create a list of tuples where each tuple represents a prime number and the difference between its maximum and minimum indices in the list.
3. Calculate the sum of ASCII values of characters in the string that have a vowel as their next character.
4. Count the frequency of distinct numbers in the integer list where each block of consecutive duplicates is considered as one occurrence. This should be returned as a dictionary without considering the prime numbers in the list.

The function should return a tuple with four elements:

- A count of the unique words that are most frequently followed by a vowel in the text.
- A list of tuples where each tuple is a prime number from the list and the difference between its highest and lowest indices.
- The sum of ASCII values of characters in the string that are immediately before a vowel.
- A dictionary representing the frequency count of distinct numbers, excluding primes, based on consecutive occurrence blocks.
