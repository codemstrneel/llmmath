QUESTION

Write a Python function to determine how many values of \( x \) satisfy a given cubic equation within a specified integer range. The cubic equation will be provided in the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \), with integer coefficients \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). The range will also be specified with integer boundaries, \( \text{low} \) and \( \text{high} \), inclusive. Your function should count how many integer solutions exist within this range and return that count.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The solution function appears to be correct, but there seem to be issues with the test cases themselves. Let's re-evaluate the problematic test cases and ensure they correctly match the expected outcomes.

The key points are:
- Ensure that the cubic equation provided actually results in the expected number of integer solutions.
- Use a correct range and ensure any unique integer solutions are within this range.

We'll revise and check the test cases, especially those that failed, ensuring logical correctness in the definitions for them.

def solution(a, b, c, d, low, high):
    """
    Determines how many integer values of x satisfy the cubic equation
    ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 within the range [low, high].

    Parameters:
    - a, b, c, d: coefficients of the cubic equation.
    - low, high: the range in which to look for integer solutions.

    Returns:
    - The count of integer values of x that satisfy the equation within the range.

    count = 0
    for x in range(low, high + 1):
        if a * x**3 + b * x**2 + c * x + d == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

from solution import solution

def test_solution_no_solution():
    assert solution(1, 0, 0, 1, -10, 10) == 0

def test_solution_one_solution():
    assert solution(1, -3, 3, -1, -10, 10) == 1  # (x-1)^3, solution x = 1

def test_solution_two_solutions():
    assert solution(1, 0, -2, 0, -10, 10) == 2  # x(x^2 - 2) = 0, solutions x = -1, 0, 1; -1 and 1 in range

def test_solution_three_solutions():
    assert solution(1, -6, 11, -6, -10, 10) == 3  # (x-1)(x-2)(x-3), solutions are x = 1, 2, 3

def test_solution_no_solution_out_of_range():
    assert solution(1, -6, 11, -6, 4, 10) == 0  # Solutions are 1, 2, 3 which are out of range [4, 10]

def test_solution_large_range():
    assert solution(1, 0, 0, 0, -10, 10) == 1  # (x^3 = 0), solution x = 0

def test_solution_no_solution_in_negative_range():
    assert solution(1, 0, 0, 0, -10, -1) == 0  # (x^3 = 0), no solution in negative range

<|Test End|>

The test case `test_solution_two_solutions` now interprets the cubic equation for which there are specifically two integer solutions within the given range. The polynomial x(x^2 - 2) = 0 has solutions -1, 0, 1, and only -1 and 1 are now asserted as within the range.
