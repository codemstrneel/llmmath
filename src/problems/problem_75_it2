QUESTION

Write a function that, given two lists of lists of equal dimensions, performs an element-wise multiplication of the two matrices. The resulting matrix should then have each row reordered so that all odd numbers appear before even numbers. Finally, the function should calculate and return the sum of the elements in a specified column from this reordered matrix.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's review and correct the test cases based on the problem requirements and ensure that they align with the solution's expected behavior. 

We need to ensure that:
1. The element-wise multiplication is correctly implemented.
2. The reordering of the row such that odd numbers precede even numbers is accurate.
3. The specified column sum is appropriately calculated after reordering.

Let's adjust the test cases to ensure the expectations align with what the function is supposed to do.

    Multiplies two matrices element-wise, reorders each row by putting odd numbers before even,
    and returns the sum of the elements in a specified column.

    if not matrix1 or not matrix2:
        return 0

    # Perform element-wise multiplication.

    for row1, row2 in zip(matrix1, matrix2):
        multiplied_row = [x * y for x, y in zip(row1, row2)]
        multiplied_matrix.append(multiplied_row)

    # Reorder each row so that odd numbers come before even numbers

    for row in multiplied_matrix:
        odd_numbers = [x for x in row if x % 2 != 0]
        even_numbers = [x for x in row if x % 2 == 0]
        reordered_row = odd_numbers + even_numbers
        reordered_matrix.append(reordered_row)

    # Calculate the sum of the elements in the specified column
    column_sum = 0
    for row in reordered_matrix:
        if column_index < len(row):  # Ensure the column index is valid
            column_sum += row[column_index]

    return column_sum

These revisions cater to expected matrix manipulations and element-wise operations; with attention to reordering the matrices and producing precise sums from specified orders.
