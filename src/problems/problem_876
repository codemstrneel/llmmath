QUESTION

To create a novel question that combines concepts from some of the given questions, we'll focus on integrating list/tuple processing and arithmetic operations alongside search algorithms. Here's a new question that synthesizes elements from Questions 1, 4, and 5.

**New Question:**

Create a Python function `process_tuples_and_find_indices` that takes a list of tuples, a sorted list of integers, and a modulus integer `p`. The function should perform the following operations:

1. For each tuple, compute the sum of its elements.
2. If the computed sum is an even number, calculate the number of combinations (nCr) mod `p`, where `n` is the sum of the elements and `r` is half of the sum (i.e., nCr(sum, sum // 2) mod p).
3. If the computed sum is odd, calculate nCr(sum, (sum-1) // 2) mod p.
4. For each calculated nCr value, search for it in the sorted list of integers. Return the index if found, otherwise return -1 for that tuple.
5. Return a new list where each element is a tuple containing the original tuple, its sum, and the index found in the sorted list (or -1 if not found).

```python
def process_tuples_and_find_indices(tuples_list, sorted_list, p):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage:
tuples = [(3, 1, 2), (4, 6), (7, 8, 9)]
sorted_list = [0, 1, 3, 6, 15, 35, 56, 84]
modulus = 1000
print(process_tuples_and_find_indices(tuples, sorted_list, modulus))
```

In this problem, you'll be combining the concepts of:
- Computing the sum of tuple elements.
- Determining whether the sum is odd or even and using this to guide calculations for combinations.
- Searching for these computed arithmetic-related values within a sorted list.
- Handling modular arithmetic in the calculations of combinations, as asked in Question 5.

```python
def nCr_mod_p(n, r, p):
    """Helper function to compute nCr % p"""
    if r > n:
        return 0
    num = 1
    den = 1
    for i in range(r):
        num = num * (n - i) % p
        den = den * (i + 1) % p
    # (num * den^(p-2)) % p is used to compute (num / den) mod p using Fermat's Little Theorem
    return (num * pow(den, p-2, p)) % p

def process_tuples_and_find_indices(tuples_list, sorted_list, p):
    result = []
    for tpl in tuples_list:
        s = sum(tpl)
        if s % 2 == 0:
            nCr_value = nCr_mod_p(s, s // 2, p)
        else:
            nCr_value = nCr_mod_p(s, (s - 1) // 2, p)
        
        # Perform a binary search to find nCr_value in sorted_list
        low, high = 0, len(sorted_list) - 1
        index = -1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if sorted_list[mid] == nCr_value:
                index = mid
                break
            elif sorted_list[mid] < nCr_value:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        
        result.append((tpl, s, index))
    return result

# Example usage:
tuples = [(3, 1, 2), (4, 6), (7, 8, 9)]
sorted_list = [0, 1, 3, 6, 15, 35, 56, 84]
modulus = 1000
print(process_tuples_and_find_indices(tuples, sorted_list, modulus))
