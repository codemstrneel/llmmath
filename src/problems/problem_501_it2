QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes an integer n and a list of integers as input. The function should perform two tasks: first, calculate the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers; second, rotate the list by moving the first element to the end. Return both results as a tuple.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the test failures, it seems there was a misunderstanding in both the test expectations and the explanations provided within the test docstrings. The problem statement asked for the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers and correctly rotating the list by moving the first element to the end. 

I will adjust the tests based on the actual function implementation and correct any inconsistencies.

The cube sum result in the test expectations was incorrect. Here is the corrected solution and test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n, int_list):
    """
    Calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers and rotates the list.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of even natural numbers to consider.
    int_list (list of int): The list of integers to rotate.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the cube sum and the rotated list.
    """
    # Task 1: Calculate cube sum of the first n even natural numbers
    even_natural_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x**3 for x in even_natural_numbers)
    
    # Task 2: Rotate the list by moving the first element to the end
    if int_list:
        rotated_list = int_list[1:] + int_list[:1]
    else:
        rotated_list = int_list  # If the list is empty, rotation has no effect
    
    return cube_sum, rotated_list
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_cube_sum_and_rotate():
    # 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288
    assert solution(3, [1, 2, 3, 4]) == (288, [2, 3, 4, 1])

def test_cube_sum_with_zero_even():
    # No even numbers, cube sum should be 0
    assert solution(0, [5, 6, 7]) == (0, [6, 7, 5])

def test_no_rotation_on_empty_list():
    # 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800
    assert solution(4, []) == (800, [])

def test_single_element_list():
    # 2^3 = 8, list unchanged as rotating a single element doesn't change
    assert solution(1, [99]) == (8, [99])

def test_large_n():
    # 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 + 10^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 + 1000 = 1800
    assert solution(5, [1, 2, 3]) == (1800, [2, 3, 1])

def test_only_one_even_number():
    # 2^3 = 8
    assert solution(1, [0, 2, 4]) == (8, [2, 4, 0])

def test_single_element_rotation():
    # 2^3 = 8
    assert solution(1, [7]) == (8, [7])
<|Test End|>

I have corrected the test case calculations for the cube sums and ensured that they properly test the solution. Each test case now matches the expected behavior of the implementation.
