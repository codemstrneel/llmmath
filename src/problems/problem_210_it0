QUESTION

Write a function to compute the total surface area of a regular prism given the base edge length and height of the prism.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The total surface area of a regular prism includes the areas of its bases and its lateral faces. For a regular prism with a polygonal base with \( n \) sides of equal length \( s \), the surface area is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Surface Area} = 2 \times \text{Area of Base} + \text{Perimeter of Base} \times \text{Height} \]

The steps to calculate the total surface area are as follows:
1. Compute the area of the base.
2. Compute the perimeter of the base.
3. Apply the formula above to get the total surface area.

To compute the area of a regular polygon base, we can use:
\[ \text{Area of Base} = \frac{n \times s^2}{4 \times \tan(\pi/n)} \]

Let's implement this solution in Python and write the necessary unit tests using pytest style.

```python
import math

def solution(n, s, h):
    """
    Compute the total surface area of a regular prism.

    Parameters:
    n (int): Number of sides of the base polygon.
    s (float): Length of each side of the base polygon.
    h (float): Height of the prism.

    Returns:
    float: The total surface area of the prism.
    """
    # Area of the base polygon
    base_area = (n * s ** 2) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / n))
    
    # Perimeter of the base polygon
    perimeter = n * s
    
    # Total surface area
    surface_area = 2 * base_area + perimeter * h
    
    return surface_area
