QUESTION

Create a function that takes a dictionary, an integer n, and a Boolean flag as input. The keys in the dictionary are strings, and the values are lists of numbers. The function should return a new dictionary where each original list of numbers is transformed by first summing the numbers and then replicating that sum n times using the map function. If the Boolean flag is set to True, the final values of the dictionary should be sorted in descending order; otherwise, they should remain in their original order of appearance.
