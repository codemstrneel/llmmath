QUESTION

Write a function that checks if all elements of a smaller list are present in a larger list in the same order, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two integers representing the lengths of these lists. If the smaller list is not entirely present in the specified order within the larger list, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's make sure the solution and tests are correctly implemented and expressed using proper Python syntax and logic. First, ensure that the solution and test blocks are properly entered. We will check for syntax errors and logical consistency.

### Possible Fixes:
1. Ensure there are no syntax issues, especially with indentation or missing syntax elements.
2. Verify that any logical implementation matches the problem statement correctly.
3. Run the test cases correctly and validate the outcomes based on expected values.

Let's implement this:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """
    Helper function to compute the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b.
    """
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def is_subsequence(small, large):
    """
    Helper function to determine if 'small' is a subsequence of 'large'.
    """
    it = iter(large)
    return all(item in it for item in small)

def solution(small, large):
    """
    Returns the GCD of lengths of small and large lists if 'small' is a subsequence of 'large',
    otherwise returns -1.
    """
    if is_subsequence(small, large):
        return gcd(len(small), len(large))
    return -1
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_gcd_of_list_lengths():
    assert solution([1, 2], [3, 1, 4, 2]) == 2
    assert solution([1, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == 1
    assert solution([1, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == 1
    assert solution([], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == 4
    assert solution([], []) == 0
    assert solution([1], [1]) == 1

def test_not_a_subsequence():
    assert solution([1, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == -1
    assert solution([2, 4], [1, 3, 4, 2]) == -1
    assert solution([2, 1], [1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 3, 5]) == -1

def test_empty_large():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], []) == -1
   
def test_smaller_in_large():
    assert solution([2], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 1
    assert solution([3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 1
```
<|Test End|>

### Key Points:
- The logic of GCD computation and subsequence checking remains unchanged.
- Proper care is given to edge cases such as empty lists.
- Each test case aligns with the expected problem requirement. 

The provided code should execute correctly assuming the syntax reflects Python standards and your testing framework supports it.
