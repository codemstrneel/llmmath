QUESTION

Write a function that takes a pascal case string where each word represents a day of the week, converts it to a kebab case string, and then returns the days in a list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's revise the provided solution and unit tests to address potential issues with running the code in a test environment. The initial error suggests a problem with the syntax around the code execution environment. We'll ensure that the code compiles and functions as intended without syntax issues.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(day_string):
    """
    Converts a PascalCase day string into a kebab-case list of the days.
    
    Parameters:
    day_string (str): PascalCase string of week days.

    Returns:
    list: List of kebab-case day strings.
    """
    import re
    # Use regex to split on each capital letter (not at the start) into a kebab-case
    kebab_string = re.sub(r'(?<!^)(?=[A-Z])', '-', day_string).lower()
    # Split the kebab-case string by '-' and filter out any empty strings
    return [day for day in kebab_string.split('-') if day]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_individual_days():
    assert solution("Monday") == ["monday"]
    assert solution("Tuesday") == ["tuesday"]
    assert solution("Wednesday") == ["wednesday"]
    assert solution("Thursday") == ["thursday"]
    assert solution("Friday") == ["friday"]
    assert solution("Saturday") == ["saturday"]
    assert solution("Sunday") == ["sunday"]

def test_combined_days():
    assert solution("MondayTuesdayWednesday") == ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday"]
    assert solution("ThursdayFriday") == ["thursday", "friday"]
    assert solution("SaturdaySundayMonday") == ["saturday", "sunday", "monday"]

def test_all_days():
    all_days = "MondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturdaySunday"
    expected = ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"]
    assert solution(all_days) == expected

def test_empty_string():
    assert solution("") == []

def test_invalid_input():
    # For extra robustness, check what happens with arbitrary invalid strings
    invalid_str = "SomedayMaybeNeverDay"
    expected_invalid = ["som", "eday", "maybe", "never", "day"]
    assert solution(invalid_str) == expected_invalid
```
<|Test End|>

This update included addressing the initial implementation's conversion nuances to handle different cases more gracefully and ensured that any runs of non-empty strings would be split and returned accordingly. The tests cover the various correct uses, improper uses, and edge cases.
