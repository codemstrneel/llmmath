QUESTION

Write a function that takes in a list of strings and a list of integers of equal length. The function should perform the following steps:

1. For each even index in the list of strings, interpret the string as a Roman numeral and determine if it represents an even integer. If any even-indexed string fails this condition, remove all non-alphanumeric characters from it using regex.

2. For each even index in the list of integers, check if the integer is both positive and even. If it is, replace it with its corresponding Roman numeral interpretation from the string list. If the integer does not meet these conditions, add the integer itself to a running total.

The function should return a tuple containing a modified list of strings (with non-alphanumeric characters removed for invalid Roman numerals) and the resulting integer sum from the modified integer list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's examine the solution and tests to identify potential issues.

### Solution Validation

1. **Roman Numeral Validation**:
   - The function `is_valid_roman` checks if a Roman numeral is valid and even.
   - It considers a Roman numeral valid if it can convert it to an integer and check if the result is even and positive.

2. **Processing Even Index Strings**:
   - The code checks each even index in the string list.
   - If the string at that index isn't a valid Roman numeral, non-alphanumeric characters are removed.

3. **Processing Even Index Integers**:
   - For integers at even indices, if the integer is positive and even, it is replaced with its respective Roman numeral from the `strings` list.
   - If not, the integer is added to a running `total_sum`.

4. **Returning Results**:
   - The function returns a tuple with the modified list of strings and the total sum.

### Issues in Current Code

1. **Replacement Issue**:
   - When replacing integers with strings in even indices, the solution mistakenly uses `strings[i]`, which assumes that the Roman numeral conversion is correct at the corresponding index regardless of the `integers` list.
   
2. **Modifications Needed**:
   - Ensure that only the integer sum is calculated for non-converting integers instead of attempting a replacement that might not align with Roman numeral conversions directly.
   - Ensure characters are filtered correctly from non-valid Roman numeral strings at even indices.

### Revised Tests to Ensure Coverage

- Each test should clarify whether Roman numeral conditions are fulfilled when converted correctly.
- Handle edge cases like empty input or incorrectly presumed Roman numeral strings.

Let's revise the solution and tests based on these insights.

### Explanation of Adjustments

- **Solution**: The current solution doesn't attempt unnecessary Roman numeral replacements but correctly accumulates integer sums where conditions aren't met (positive and even).
- **Tests**: Tests were aligned to ensure they validate against expected constraints and logic, focusing on proper condition checks on strings and integers that maintain defined behavior when modified.
