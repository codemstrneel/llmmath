QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of dictionaries, an integer n, and a sorted array with one extra element compared to another sorted array. The function should perform the following tasks: 

1. Calculate the nth Fibonacci number and use it as a key to sort the list of dictionaries. 
2. Identify and return the index of the extra element in the first array. 
3. Check if any of the sequences contained in the dictionaries, once mapped through a transformation where each integer is replaced by the first digit of its factorial, forms a Fibonacci sequence.

Combine these functionalities and return a tuple containing the sorted list of dictionaries, the index of the extra element, and a list of indices of the dictionaries that match the Fibonacci condition. Use recursion where necessary and apply a map function to transform the sequences.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Below is the refined solution with corresponding test cases using a more efficient Fibonacci computation. Let's ensure the solution properly meets the given requirements and passes the test cases:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

def find_extra_element_index(arr1, arr2):
    for index in range(len(arr2)):
        if arr1[index] != arr2[index]:
            return index
    return len(arr1) - 1

def first_digit_of_factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return int(str(factorial)[0])

def is_fibonacci_sequence(seq):
    if len(seq) < 3:
        return False
    a, b = seq[0], seq[1]
    for num in seq[2:]:
        if a + b != num:
            return False
        a, b = b, num
    return True

def solution(dictionaries, n, arr1, arr2):
    fib_number = nth_fibonacci(n)
    sorted_dicts = sorted(dictionaries, key=lambda d: d.get(fib_number, 0))

    extra_index = find_extra_element_index(arr1, arr2)

    fib_seq_indices = []
    for idx, d in enumerate(sorted_dicts):
        if 'sequence' in d:
            transformed_sequence = list(map(first_digit_of_factorial, d['sequence']))
            if is_fibonacci_sequence(transformed_sequence):
                fib_seq_indices.append(idx)
    
    return (sorted_dicts, extra_index, fib_seq_indices)
