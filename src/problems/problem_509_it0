QUESTION

Write a Python function to find all the rational solutions of a given non-degenerate quadratic equation, if any exist.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to find all rational solutions to a non-degenerate quadratic equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. A rational solution of this equation will be in the form of a fraction where both numerator and denominator are integers with the denominator being non-zero.

For a quadratic equation, the roots are given by the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

To ensure the roots are rational, the discriminant (\(D = b^2 - 4ac\)) must be a perfect square. If \(D\) is a perfect square, then the square root of \(D\) is an integer, leading to the possibility of rational roots.

Here's the solution function and corresponding unit tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def is_perfect_square(n):
    """ Helper function to check if a number is a perfect square """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

def solution(a, b, c):
    discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c
    if not is_perfect_square(discriminant):
        return []  # No rational solutions, since discriminant is not a perfect square

    sqrt_d = int(math.isqrt(discriminant))
    root1 = Fraction(-b + sqrt_d, 2 * a)
    root2 = Fraction(-b - sqrt_d, 2 * a)
    
    if root1 == root2:
        return [root1]  # Only one unique rational solution exists
    else:
        return [root1, root2]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution
from fractions import Fraction

def test_no_rational_solution():
    assert solution(1, 0, 1) == []

def test_single_rational_solution():
    assert solution(1, 2, 1) == [Fraction(-1)]

def test_two_rational_solutions():
    result = solution(1, -3, 2)
    assert Fraction(1) in result and Fraction(2) in result
    assert len(result) == 2
    
def test_negative_discriminant():
    assert solution(1, 0, 2) == []

def test_relative_primes():
    result = solution(2, -7, 3)
    assert Fraction(3, 2) in result and Fraction(1) in result
    assert len(result) == 2
```
<|Test End|>

This implementation and its corresponding tests should correctly find and verify rational solutions, if any exist, for a given non-degenerate quadratic equation.
