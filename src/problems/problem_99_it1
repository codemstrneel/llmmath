QUESTION

Write a function that cyclically rotates a given list by a specified number of positions to the right or left, allowing for both positive and negative values, while accommodating nested sublists to arbitrary depth. After transforming the list, implement a search using regex within each sublist or string element to identify whether a specified pattern exists, and return a list of booleans indicating its presence or absence throughout the transformed list structure.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the code execution output, it seems that there is an incorrect implementation in either the solution or the test cases, specifically related to the expected outputs for each test. Let's refine the solution and ensure the tests are correctly aligned with the requirements, focusing on cyclic rotation and pattern matching functionalities.

### Revised Solution
We need to address how the boolean results are collected during the pattern search, ensuring they correctly reflect the nested structure after rotation.

### Solution and Tests
Below is the corrected solution and updated tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
import re

def solution(lst, rotate_by, pattern):
    def rotate_list(input_list, num):
        """Cyclically rotate a list by num positions."""
        if not input_list:
            return input_list
        n = len(input_list)
        num = num % n  # to handle rotations larger than list size
        return input_list[-num:] + input_list[:-num]

    def search_pattern(item, regex_pattern):
        """Search for a regex pattern in the item, handling both strings and nested lists."""
        if isinstance(item, list):
            return [search_pattern(subitem, regex_pattern) for subitem in item]
        elif isinstance(item, str):
            return bool(re.search(regex_pattern, item))
        return False  # if the item is not a string or list, return False

    # Rotate the main list
    rotated_list = rotate_list(lst, rotate_by)

    # Search for the pattern in the rotated list
    result = search_pattern(rotated_list, pattern)

    return result
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
import re
from solution import solution

def test_rotate_and_search():
    lst = ["abc", ["def", "ghi"], "jkl", ["mno", ["pqr", "stu"]]]
    rotate_by = 2
    pattern = r"jkl"
    # After a rotation by 2: ["mno", ["pqr", "stu"], "abc", ["def", "ghi"], "jkl"]
    assert solution(lst, rotate_by, pattern) == [False, [False, False], False, [False, False], True]

def test_negative_rotate_and_search():
    lst = ["abc", ["def", "ghi"], "jkl", ["mno", ["pqr", "stu"]]]
    rotate_by = -1
    pattern = r"abc"
    # After a rotation by -1: [["def", "ghi"], "jkl", ["mno", ["pqr", "stu"]], "abc"]
    assert solution(lst, rotate_by, pattern) == [[False, False], False, [False, [False, False]], True]

def test_nested_sublists_and_search():
    lst = [["a", ["b", "c"]], "d", ["e", "f"]]
    rotate_by = 1
    pattern = r"b"
    # After a rotation by 1: [["e", "f"], ["a", ["b", "c"]], "d"]
    assert solution(lst, rotate_by, pattern) == [[False, False], [False, [True, False]], False]

def test_large_rotate():
    lst = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    rotate_by = 100  # large rotation which is effectively rotating 0 positions
    pattern = r"a"
    # List stays the same due to modulo: ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    assert solution(lst, rotate_by, pattern) == [True, False, False, False]

def test_no_search_pattern_found():
    lst = ["xyz", "nop", ["qrst", "uvw"]]
    rotate_by = 2
    pattern = r"abc"
    # After a rotation by 2: [["qrst", "uvw"], "xyz", "nop"]
    assert solution(lst, rotate_by, pattern) == [[False, False], False, False]
<|Test End|>

This updated solution ensures that the structure of the output boolean list correctly represents the structure of the input list after rotation, and the tests verify this behavior.
