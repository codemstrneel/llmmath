QUESTION

Create a function that takes two lists and one string as inputs. First, determine if all elements of the first list are present in the second list. Next, assess whether the given string can be constructed by rearranging the letters from another string formed by concatenating all elements of the second list. If both conditions are met, return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of the two lists; otherwise, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Upon reviewing the test cases and the constraints, we need to slightly adjust them to ensure that the conditions are being tested properly, especially taking into account the logical expectations from the task outline. Let's correct these issues in the tests so that they align with the intended functionality. 

Here's the corrected version:

<|Solution Begin|>
from math import gcd
from collections import Counter

def solution(list1, list2, target_string):
    # Check if all elements in list1 are present in list2
    if not all(elem in list2 for elem in list1):
        return -1

    # Construct a concatenated string of all elements in list2
    concatenated_list2 = ''.join(list2)

    # Create dictionaries of character counts
    target_count = Counter(target_string)
    concatenated_list2_count = Counter(concatenated_list2)

    # Check if the target string can be constructed from concatenated_list2
    for char, count in target_count.items():
        if concatenated_list2_count[char] < count:
            return -1

    # Both conditions are met, return the GCD of the lengths of list1 and list2
    return gcd(len(list1), len(list2))
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_both_conditions_true():
    assert solution(['a'], ['a', 'b'], 'ab') == 1  # GCD(1, 2) = 1
    assert solution(['a', 'b'], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'abc') == 1  # GCD(2, 3) = 1
    assert solution(['x', 'y'], ['x', 'y', 'z'], 'yx') == 1  # GCD(2, 3) = 1

def test_element_absent_from_second_list():
    assert solution(['a', 'd'], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'abc') == -1  # 'd' is not in list2
    assert solution(['x'], ['y', 'z'], 'x') == -1  # 'x' is not in list2

def test_string_cannot_be_formed():
    assert solution(['a', 'b'], ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'abcd') == -1  # 'd' cannot be formed
    assert solution(['x', 'y'], ['x', 'y'], 'zyxv') == -1  # 'v' cannot be formed

def test_both_conditions_false():
    assert solution(['d'], ['x', 'y'], 'z') == -1  # 'd' is not in list2 and 'z' cannot be formed
    assert solution(['w'], ['x', 'y', 'z'], 'zyxv') == -1  # 'w' is not in list2 and 'v' cannot be formed

def test_gcd_calculated_correctly():
    assert solution(['a', 'b', 'c'], ['b', 'c', 'a'], 'bca') == 3  # GCD(3, 3) = 3
    assert solution(['a', 'b'], ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a'], 'abb') == 1  # GCD(2, 4) = 2

def test_empty_list1_and_valid_target():
    assert solution([], ['x', 'y', 'z'], 'zyx') == 0  # GCD(0, 3) = 3
    assert solution([], [], '') == 0  # GCD(0, 0) = 0

def test_empty_list2():
    assert solution(['x', 'y'], [], '') == -1  # Non-empty list1 with empty list2 and non-possible target

<|Test End|>

**Adjustments Made:**
- Revisited conditions for returning -1 correctly and empty list handling.
- Fixed test case logic to better align with how strings and elements should be present.
- Clarified GCD expectations, especially with edge cases.
- Ensured alignment on empty lists and the logic of possibility versus result expectations.
