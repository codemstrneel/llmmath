Certainly! Hereâ€™s a novel coding question that combines core concepts from the provided questions:

**New Question:**

Write a function that processes a list of pairs and a string in the following way:

1. **Longest Chain of Pairs:** From a given list of pairs, identify the longest chain that can be formed. A chain of pairs is defined where for any given pair \((x, y)\) in the chain, there exists a subsequent pair \((y, z)\).

2. **Derived String Manipulation:** Take a string and remove all non-alphanumeric characters using regex, then extract subsequences from this cleaned string based on the indices dictated by the starting positions of each pair in the longest chain. Ensure that none of the extracted subsequences overlap and that they maintain character order as in the original string.

3. **Check Tuples and Polynomial:** Using a provided quadratic polynomial in the form "ax^2 + bx + c = 0", calculate whether the number of distinct real roots is even or odd. Additionally, verify if for each pair in the longest chain (considered as tuples), each element of the second tuple in the pair exceeds the corresponding element of the first.

4. **Output:** Return a tuple containing the list of extracted non-overlapping subsequences, a boolean indicating whether the distinct real roots are even, and a boolean for whether all pairs meet the tuple condition.

**Example:**

Given pairs = \[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)], string = "a!b@c#d$e%f^", and polynomial = "x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0":

- The longest chain is \[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)].
- Extracted subsequences from cleaned string "abcdef" based on pairs starting positions: \["ab", "bc", "cd"\].
- The polynomial "x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0" has 1 real root (odd).
- Check if each element in second tuple of the pair is greater than the first: True for all pairs.

Hence, the function should return \((["ab", "bc", "cd"], False, True)\).

This question blends the concepts of finding chains in pairs, regex-based string cleaning, polynomial root analysis, and tuple comparison, creating an engaging and comprehensive problem.

SOL & TESTS

To solve this complex problem, let's address each part step by step:

1. **Longest Chain of Pairs:** We need to identify the longest chain from a list of pairs such that each pair \((x, y)\) is followed by another pair \((y, z)\). We can leverage a dynamic approach to compute this efficiently.

2. **Derived String Manipulation:** Once we have the longest chain, clean the input string using a regex to remove all non-alphanumeric characters. Then, extract subsequences based on the starting indices specified by each pair in the longest chain, ensuring no overlaps occur and character order is preserved.

3. **Polynomial Analysis:** Calculate the roots of a quadratic polynomial using the discriminant method and determine if the count of distinct real roots is even or odd.

4. **Tuple Comparisons:** For each pair in the longest chain, confirm that each element of the second tuple is greater than the corresponding element of the first tuple.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import re

def longest_chain(pairs):
    # Create a graph-like structure to store the chains
    from collections import defaultdict
    adj = defaultdict(list)
    for (x, y) in pairs:
        adj[x].append(y)

    # Use DFS to find the longest chain
    longest = []

    def dfs(chain):
        nonlocal longest
        last = chain[-1]
        if last in adj:
            for next in adj[last]:
                dfs(chain + [next])
        else:
            if len(chain) > len(longest):
                longest = list(chain)

    # Start chains from different starting points
    for (x, _) in pairs:
        dfs([x])

    return longest

def process_pairs_and_string(pairs, string, polynomial):
    # Part 1: Find the longest chain
    chain = longest_chain(pairs)

    # Part 2: Process the string
    cleaned_string = re.sub(r'\W+', '', string)
    subsequences = []
    pos = 0
    
    for i in range(len(chain) - 1):
        start_idx = chain[i] - 1
        end_idx = chain[i + 1] - 1
        subsequences.append(cleaned_string[start_idx:end_idx + 1])
    
    # Part 3: Polynomial root analysis
    terms = polynomial.replace('=', '').replace(' ', '').split('+')
    a, b, c = 0, 0, 0
    for term in terms:
        if 'x^2' in term:
            a = int(term.replace('x^2', '') or '1')  # Handle the cases like "x^2"
        elif 'x' in term:
            b = int(term.replace('x', '') or '1')  # Handle the cases like "x"
        else:
            c = int(term)

    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    if discriminant > 0:
        distinct_real_roots_count = 2
    elif discriminant == 0:
        distinct_real_roots_count = 1
    else:
        distinct_real_roots_count = 0

    roots_even = distinct_real_roots_count % 2 == 0

    # Part 4: Check tuples
    all_greater = all(y > chain[i] for i, y in enumerate(chain[1:]))

    return subsequences, roots_even, all_greater
