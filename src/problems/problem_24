QUESTION

Write a Python function to find the slope of a line passing through two points, then determine if the line is parallel to the x-axis, y-axis, or neither.

```python
def find_slope(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """
    Determines the slope of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
    and checks if the line is parallel to the x-axis, y-axis, or neither.
    
    Returns a tuple (slope, description):
    - slope: the calculated slope (float or None if undefined)
    - description: a string indicating if the line is parallel to the x-axis, y-axis, or neither
    
    If the slope is undefined (vertical line), the function will return (None, "Parallel to y-axis")
    """
    if x1 == x2:
        return None, "Parallel to y-axis"
    elif y1 == y2:
        return 0.0, "Parallel to x-axis"
    else:
        slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
        return slope, "Neither"
