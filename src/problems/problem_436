QUESTION

To create a new coding question that combines key concepts from the provided questions, let's blend text and data sequence processing with an emphasis on frequency analysis and pattern detection. We aim to devise a novel problem that synthesizes word/character properties, sequence manipulation, and numerical operations. Here's the new question:

---

**New Combined Question:**

Develop a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of paragraphs (each represented as a string) and a list of real numbers (both integers and floats). The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **Text Character Processing and Pattern Analysis:**
   - In each paragraph, identify and process words where each character, when converted to its ASCII value, forms a strictly increasing sequence (e.g., "ace" because `97 < 99 < 101`).
   - Return a dictionary with these unique words as keys. The value for each key should be the count of its occurrence across all paragraphs and the index of the first paragraph where it appears.

2. **Numerical Sequence and Transformation:**
   - From the list of numbers, convert each number to its nearest integer and identify sequences composed entirely of even numbers.
   - Return the longest sequence of consecutive evens found. If there is a tie in lengths, return the sequence with the smaller starting integer.

3. **Overall Analysis:**
   - Determine the unique word with the highest frequency, based on the processed text from step 1.
   - Identify the most frequently occurring number from the list after transformation in step 2.
   - Return these prominent elements along with their frequencies in a tuple.

The function should ultimately return a tuple containing:
- The dictionary from step 1.
- The longest sequence of even integers from step 2.
- A tuple consisting of the most common "character-as-ASCII-sequence" word and the most frequent even integer along with their counts.

**Example Input and Output:**

```python
paragraphs = [
    "Every action performed by actors resonates", 
    "Their importance cannot be understated", 
    "Important changes are imminent"
]
numbers = [6.9, 2.2, 4, 5.5, 12, 14.9, 3, 0.7, 14]

result = your_function(paragraphs, numbers)

# Expected Output:
(
  { 'actors': (1, 0), 'be': (1, 1)}, # Example dictionary
  [2, 4],  # Longest sequence of consecutive even integers
  ('be', 1, 4, 2)  # Most frequent pattern word and integer with counts
)
```

This problem requires understanding of character properties via ASCII codes, sequence manipulation, and frequency analysis, blending various elements from the initial set of problems into a cohesive challenge.

        if current_sequence and current_sequence[0] < longest_even_sequence[0]:
            longest_even_sequence = current_sequence

    # Step 3: Determine the most frequent word and number
    highest_frequency_word = max(word_dict.keys(), key=lambda k: word_dict[k][0] if word_dict else 0)

    from collections import Counter
    number_frequency = Counter(rounded_numbers)
