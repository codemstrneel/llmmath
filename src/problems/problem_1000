QUESTION

Write a Python function to count the number of distinct power of prime factor of a given number, and determine if their product exceeds 1000.

SOL & TESTS

To solve the problem of counting the number of distinct powers of prime factors of a number and determining if their product exceeds 1000, we first need a function that factors a number into its prime factors with their respective powers. Then we can compute the product of the distinct powers and compare it to 1000.

```python
from collections import Counter
from math import prod

def prime_factors(n):
    """
    Return a dictionary where keys are the prime factors of n and
    values are their respective powers.
    """
    i = 2
    factors = Counter()
    while i*i <= n:
        while (n % i) == 0:
            factors[i] += 1
            n //= i
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] += 1
    return factors

def product_exceeds_1000(n):
    """
    Determines whether the product of distinct powers of prime factors of n exceeds 1000.

    Returns True if product exceeds 1000, otherwise False.
    """
    factors = prime_factors(n)
    distinct_powers = factors.values()
    return prod(distinct_powers) > 1000

```python
import pytest
from solution import product_exceeds_1000

def test_small_number_does_not_exceed():
    assert not product_exceeds_1000(30)  # 30 = 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1, product of powers = 1

def test_large_number_exceeds():
    # Large number: n = 2^1000, product of powers = 1000
    assert product_exceeds_1000(2**1001)  # Product of powers = 1001

def test_no_primes_exceeds():
    assert not product_exceeds_1000(1)  # No prime factors, product is 1

def test_exact_1000_should_ne():
    assert not product_exceeds_1000(2**500 * 3**250)  # 500 * 250 = 1000, should return False

def test_large_mixed_factors():
    assert product_exceeds_1000((2**20) * (3**10) * (5**7))  # Product is 20 * 10 * 7 = 1400

def test_large_power_below_limit():
    # Represents a large number but doesn't exceed
    assert not product_exceeds_1000(97**3)  # Product is 3 < 1000
```

```

This implementation uses the `Counter` class to track prime factors and their powers efficiently, determines the product of these powers, and checks if it exceeds 1000. The solution includes various tests to cover possible edge cases, ensuring that the implementation is robust.
