QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that processes a list of non-zero integer pairs and a list of strings. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify the longest chain of pairs in which each pair (a, b) can be connected to another pair (c, d) if b < c, similar to finding the longest chain of pairs.
2. Within the identified longest chain, each pair (a, b) will determine indices to extract characters from the provided list of strings. From each string, extract only the characters located at positions corresponding to indices 'a' to 'b' inclusively.
3. Construct a new list of non-overlapping character sequences by ensuring that for each pair in the chain, the extracted subsequences are continuous, unique, and contain at least one vowel.
4. Return the list of these character sequences while maintaining the relative order of the original pairs, without using additional space for storing the full array of indexes or strings.

**Example Input:**
- Pairs: `[(1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 6)]`
- Strings: `["example", "connection", "programming"]`

**Expected Output:**
- List of non-overlapping character sequences: `["xamp", "onnec"]` 

This question combines the concepts of finding the longest chain of pairs from Question 2 and manipulating lists in-place from Questions 1 and 4, as well as ensuring unique sequences with specific criteria.
