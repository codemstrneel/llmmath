QUESTION

New Question:
Write a function that processes a list of elements, where the function will iterate through the list and perform two tasks simultaneously:
1. Count the number of elements up to, but not including, the first occurrence of a tuple.
2. Within this counted sublist, identify and return a dictionary mapping each unique element to its frequency, specifically focusing on consecutive duplicates (i.e., treating only consecutive duplicates as significant for the frequency count). If there are no tuples in the list, perform the operations on the entire list.

For example, given the list `[1, 2, 2, (3, 4), 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]`, the output should be `({'1': 1, '2': 2}, 3)`, where the dictionary `{'1': 1, '2': 2}` reflects the frequency of consecutive duplicates in the sublist leading up to the first tuple, and the number `3` represents the count of elements before the first tuple.
