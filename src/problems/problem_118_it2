QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains positive integers representing side lengths of potential triangles, and a tuple with three integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each sublist, determine whether it forms a valid triangle. If the triangle is valid and the perimeter of the triangle is odd, calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula and round it up to two decimal places. Sum all these areas.

2. Check if the sum of areas is within the inclusive range specified by the first two integers of the tuple. If it is, proceed to find all integers in the list, concatenate them into a single string, and remove all characters except letters and numbers.

3. Return a dictionary with two key-value pairs:
   - "filtered_string": the cleaned string from step 2.
   - "area_sum": the summed areas from step 1 (consider only valid triangles with odd perimeters).

Assume all sublists contain at least three elements, that all side lengths are positive integers, and that the tuple contains distinct integers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address any discrepancies from the previous attempts and ensure our solution and the corresponding tests resolve correctly.

### Key Points in the Solution
1. **Triangle Validity**: Verify that the given sides satisfy the triangle inequality rule.
2. **Heron's Formula**: Calculate the area using Heron's formula, ensuring rounding is applied correctly after calculation.
3. **Odd Perimeter**: Only consider triangles with an odd perimeter for the area summation.
4. **Range Checking**: Validate the sum of areas within the specified tuple range.
5. **String Filtering**: If the sum of areas is within the range, produce a concatenated and filtered string of the integers from the triangle lists.

Let's refine the solution and ensure each test assesses the key components properly.

### Solution Review
The solution logic appears sound, but we need to make sure the testing cases match this logic. Let's adjust the solution slightly if necessary, but focus primarily on testing.

### Revised Solution
```python
def solution(triangle_lists, range_tuple):
    from math import sqrt
    
    def is_valid_triangle(sides):
        a, b, c = sorted(sides)
        return a + b > c

    def herons_area(sides):
        a, b, c = sides
        s = (a + b + c) / 2.0
        area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        return round(area, 2)

    # Step 1: Calculate total area
    total_area = 0
    for sides in triangle_lists:
        if len(sides) < 3:
            continue
        if is_valid_triangle(sides):
            a, b, c = sides
            perimeter = a + b + c
            if perimeter % 2 == 1:  # Check for odd perimeter
                total_area += herons_area(sides)

    lower_bound, upper_bound, _ = range_tuple

    # Step 2: Check if area is within range and filter string
    if lower_bound <= total_area <= upper_bound:
        filtered_string = ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, ''.join(map(str, [x for sublist in triangle_lists for x in sublist]))))
    else:
        filtered_string = ''

    return {
        "filtered_string": filtered_string,
        "area_sum": total_area
    }
```

### Revised Tests
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_example_case():
    triangle_lists = [[3, 4, 5], [6, 8, 10], [10, 6, 8]]
    range_tuple = (0, 50, 0)
    result = solution(triangle_lists, range_tuple)
    assert result == {"filtered_string": "345681068", "area_sum": 6.0}  # Note: Only [3,4,5] contributes to area

def test_solution_no_valid_triangles():
    triangle_lists = [[1, 1, 3], [1, 2, 4], [2, 2, 5]]
    range_tuple = (0, 10, 0)
    result = solution(triangle_lists, range_tuple)
    assert result == {"filtered_string": "", "area_sum": 0.0}  # No valid triangles found

def test_solution_odd_perimeter_check():
    triangle_lists = [[3, 4, 5], [7, 24, 25]]  # Only the first has odd perimeter
    range_tuple = (0, 100, 0)
    result = solution(triangle_lists, range_tuple)
    assert result == {"filtered_string": "3472425", "area_sum": 6.0}  # Only [3,4,5] is added

def test_solution_out_of_range_no_string():
    triangle_lists = [[3, 4, 5], [6, 8, 10]]
    range_tuple = (13, 20, 0)  # Total area 6.0 is out of bounds
    result = solution(triangle_lists, range_tuple)
    assert result == {"filtered_string": "", "area_sum": 6.0}  # Area is out of range

def test_solution_odd_and_valid_with_empty_string_case():
    triangle_lists = [[3, 4, 5], [7, 7, 2]]  # First is valid, second does not form a triangle
    range_tuple = (5, 7, 0)
    result = solution(triangle_lists, range_tuple)
    assert result == {"filtered_string": "34772", "area_sum": 6.0}  # Only [3,4,5] is valid and summed
```

Ensure to execute these tests in your Python testing environment to verify correctness. Adjust test parameters if certain conditions alter expected results when testing in various environments.
