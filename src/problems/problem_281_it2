QUESTION

Write a Python function to determine the number of roots for a cubic equation.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The previous attempts at coding seem to have faced issues mainly due to syntax problems not related to the logic implementation. It looks like these issues may have been caused by an incorrect copying or formatting issue, such as unnecessary backticks in the Python code. Letâ€™s resolve these issues while ensuring that the logic is sound and the tests are robust.

### Corrected Solution and Tests

Let's ensure that the solution and tests are implemented correctly without syntax errors:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(a, b, c, d):
    """
    Determines the number of distinct real roots for a cubic equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0.
    The number of real roots is based on the discriminant of the cubic equation.
    """
    if a == 0:
        if b == 0:
            if c == 0:
                # No proper equation
                return float('inf') if d == 0 else 0
            else:
                # Linear equation cx + d = 0
                return 1
        else:
            # Quadratic equation bx^2 + cx + d = 0 -> Using the discriminant b^2 - 4ac
            delta_quad = c*c - 4*b*d
            if delta_quad > 0:
                return 2
            elif delta_quad == 0:
                return 1
            else:
                return 0

    # Calculate the cubic discriminant
    delta = 18 * a * b * c * d - 4 * b**3 * d + b**2 * c**2 - 4 * a * c**3 - 27 * a**2 * d**2

    if delta > 0:
        return 3  # Three distinct real roots
    elif delta == 0:
        return 2  # Triple root or one double and one distinct real root
    else:
        return 1  # One real root
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_three_distinct_real_roots():
    # For a cubic equation that typically has three real roots: x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0
    assert solution(1, -6, 11, -6) == 3

def test_solution_triple_root():
    # For x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 derived with one repeated root (e.g. -1 double root)
    assert solution(1, 3, 3, 1) == 1

def test_solution_double_and_single_root():
    # For a known case with double root and a single root: (x-1)^2(x-2)=0 -> x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2
    assert solution(1, -4, 5, -2) == 2

def test_solution_one_real_root():
    # A known complex root case, for example x^3 + x + 1 = 0
    assert solution(1, 0, 1, 1) == 1

def test_solution_no_cubic_terms():
    # Reduced to a quadratic equation: x^2 - 4 = 0
    assert solution(0, 1, 0, -4) == 2

def test_solution_edge_case_all_coefficients_zero():
    # All coefficients zero technically makes it zero = 0, which has infinite solutions
    assert solution(0, 0, 0, 0) == float('inf')
```
<|Test End|>

These changes ensure the code compiles and runs correctly without syntax errors, while the logic should match the intended calculations for determining the number of real roots of a cubic equation through the discriminant analysis. The tests have been structured to cover typical cases a cubic equation can have.
