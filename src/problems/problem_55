QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that combines number and string processing to analyze sequences within a numerical and character-based structure. The function should take a list of integers (which may represent transaction IDs) and a string representing a sentence or mathematical expression with words and symbols. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify and return all sequences in the list of integers where consecutive numbers have an even difference (similar to identifying a pattern or sequence).

2. Check the evenness of word lengths in the string and return a count of words with even lengths.

3. Locate the position at which the total numeric value of identified even-difference sequences could be inserted into a sorted list to maintain order, without modifying the input list.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- A list of identified even-difference integer sequences.
- The count of words with even lengths.
- The list of positions where each identified sequence's sum could be inserted into the sorted list.

**Explanation:**

This question synthesizes elements from multiple source questions. Task 1 is a numerical pattern identification akin to finding specific numbers (Question 1) and involves analyzing sequences. Task 2 checks evenness properties, mirroring the concept from Question 2 on handling word lengths. Task 3 involves finding an insertion point for a numerical value in a sorted context, inspired by Question 3. The challenge requires integrating number sequence analysis and string manipulation in a multi-step process.
