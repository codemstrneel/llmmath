QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of integers and a number representing the number of left rotations to perform on this list. After performing the rotations, compute the maximum number among the sum of squares of the integers in the rotated list and return its position in the list. If there is more than one such number, return the position of the rightmost occurrence.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The current solution seems to focus on finding the maximum element in the rotated list instead of finding the maximum sum of squares and its position. Let's adjust the solution to adhere to the original problem's requirements, and update the tests accordingly.

The correct approach should be to compute the sum of squares of each element after performing left rotations and then find the position of the rightmost element for which this sum is maximum.

Below is the corrected solution and relevant test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(arr, rotations):
    """
    Rotates the list 'arr' to the left by 'rotations' places and returns 
    the position of the rightmost element that has the maximum sum of squares.
    """
    if not arr:
        return -1  # return -1 if the list is empty
    
    n = len(arr)
    # Handling more rotations than the length of the array
    rotations = rotations % n
    # Perform the left rotations
    rotated = arr[rotations:] + arr[:rotations]
    
    # Find the rightmost position of the element with the maximum sum of squares
    max_square = max(rotated, key=lambda x: x**2)
    # Return the rightmost position where this maximum sum of squares occurs
    rightmost_position = len(rotated) - 1 - rotated[::-1].index(max_square)
    
    return rightmost_position

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_example():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == 2  # [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]; max square 5 at position 2

def test_solution_single_element():
    assert solution([10], 3) == 0  # Only one element

def test_solution_two_elements():
    assert solution([5, 7], 1) == 0  # [7, 5]; max square 7 at position 0

def test_empty_array():
    assert solution([], 5) == -1  # Empty list

def test_no_rotation():
    assert solution([2, 4, 1], 0) == 1  # [2, 4, 1]; max square 4 at position 1

def test_solution_all_zeros():
    assert solution([0, 0, 0], 5) == 2  # All same, rightmost index 2

def test_solution_large_rotations():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 10) == 2  # Effective rotation is 10 % 3 = 1, max square 3 at position 2

def test_solution_negatives():
    assert solution([-3, -2, -6, -1], 3) == 3  # [-1, -3, -2, -6]; rightmost max square at position 3

def test_solution_repeated_max_squares():
    assert solution([1, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2) == 3  # [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]; rightmost max square (3) at position 3

<|Test End|>

By modifying the solution to correctly calculate the maximum sum of squares and ascertain its rightmost position, as well as updating the test cases, we should now have a more robust solution that meets the problem's requirements.
