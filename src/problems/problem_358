QUESTION

Create a function that combines and sorts elements from two given lists. The first list consists exclusively of integers 0, 1, and 2, and should be sorted in a single pass without using any sorting algorithms or additional data structures (other than a few constant extra variables). The second list is a generic list of numbers that should be filtered to include only positive numbers before being combined with the first list. Finally, the combined list should be sorted in ascending order using an efficient sorting algorithm or a suitable library function.

**Guidelines:**
- Handle the sorting of the first list by considering it analogous to the classic "Dutch National Flag" problem, using constant extra space.
- Use a lambda function to filter positive numbers from the second list.
- Combine the filtered and sorted lists and use a single efficient sorting pass for the combined list.

```python
def combine_and_sort_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    Combines and sorts elements from two lists.
    The first list contains only 0s, 1s, and 2s, and is sorted in a single pass.
    The second list is filtered to include only positive numbers.
    The final combined list is sorted using an efficient sorting algorithm.

    # Sort list1 using the Dutch National Flag algorithm
    low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(list1) - 1
    while mid <= high:

            list1[low], list1[mid] = list1[mid], list1[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif list1[mid] == 1:
            mid += 1
        else:  # list1[mid] == 2
            list1[mid], list1[high] = list1[high], list1[mid]
            high -= 1

    # Filter list2 to include only positive numbers
    filtered_list2 = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, list2))
    
    # Combine both lists and sort
    combined_list = list1 + filtered_list2
    combined_sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
