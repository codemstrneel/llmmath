QUESTION

Write a function that processes a given list of tuples, removes any that are empty, and then identifies the top k tuples based on the combined criteria of having the highest sum of numeric elements and the fewest empty strings within each tuple. If multiple tuples have the same sum, prioritize those with fewer empty strings. In cases of further ties, prefer tuples with the smallest lexicographical order.
