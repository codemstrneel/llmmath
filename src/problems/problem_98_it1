QUESTION

Write a function to find all the equilibrium indices of the given array that meet the additional condition: the value at the equilibrium index must be greater than the average of all elements in the array.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the chat history and test failure details, it seems there are issues with understanding equilibrium index requirements in the tests. I'll correct the tests to ensure they match the intended functionality, and re-evaluate edge cases.

### Revised Solution and Unit Tests

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(arr):
    """
    Finds all equilibrium indices in the array where 
    the value at the index is greater than the average of all elements.
    An equilibrium index is an index where the sum of elements on the left is equal to the sum of elements on the right.
    """
    if not arr:
        return []

    total_sum = sum(arr)
    left_sum = 0
    avg = total_sum / len(arr)
    equilibrium_indices = []

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        right_sum = total_sum - left_sum - arr[i]

        if left_sum == right_sum and arr[i] > avg:
            equilibrium_indices.append(i)
        
        left_sum += arr[i]
        
    return equilibrium_indices
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_empty():
    assert solution([]) == []

def test_solution_no_equilibrium():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3]) == []

def test_solution_single_element():
    assert solution([5]) == [0]  # since the only element is trivially an equilibrium

def test_solution_all_elements_equal():
    assert solution([10, 10, 10, 10, 10]) == []

def test_solution_with_valid_equilibria():
    # Average of array is 2.5. Equilibrium indices are 2 and 4
    assert solution([1, 3, 5, 2, 2]) == []

def test_solution_multiple_equilibria():
    assert solution([-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]) == [3]

def test_solution_edge_cases():
    # More complex scenarios
    assert solution([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]) == [4]
    assert solution([0, 0, 0, 0]) == []
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == []
<|Test End|>

With these modifications, the tests should more accurately reflect the intended behavior of finding equilibrium indices where the value at the index is greater than the average of the array. Let me know if further tweaks are needed!
