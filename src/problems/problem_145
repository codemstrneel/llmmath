QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that processes a list of floating-point numbers and a corresponding list of strings. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **Validation:** For each floating-point number, ensure it can have up to 3 decimal places. If a number doesn't meet this criterion, skip processing for that index.

2. **Pattern Matching and String-Length Check:** For each corresponding string in the list, check if it contains a pattern of an 'a' followed by any number of 'b's. Also, ensure that the string's length (after removing any leading and trailing whitespace) is even.

3. **Processing:** From the indices where both the floating-point number is valid, and the string meets the pattern and length conditions, create a sublist.

4. **Mapping and Filtering:** Use the map and lambda functions to multiply the valid floating-point numbers by the length of their corresponding strings. Filter out results where the product is less than 50.

5. **Output:** Return the maximum product obtained from step 4. If no valid products are found, return None.

This question integrates validation of floating-point precision, pattern matching within strings, even length verification, and higher-order functions using mapping and filtering of lists.

        if not (isinstance(num, float) and round(num, 3) == num):
            continue
        
        # Clean up string
        cleaned_string = string.strip()

        # Validate string with pattern matching and even length
        if pattern.fullmatch(cleaned_string) and len(cleaned_string) % 2 == 0:
            # Calculate product
            product = num * len(cleaned_string)
            results.append(product)
    
    # Filter products greater or equal to 50
    filtered_results = list(filter(lambda x: x >= 50, results))
    
    # Return the maximum of the valid products
    return max(filtered_results, default=None)
