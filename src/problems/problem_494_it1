QUESTION

Write a Python function to find the cube sum of the first n odd natural numbers, and also ensure the function handles the case where n is a large number efficiently, considering both time and space complexity.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The initial solution provided a mathematical formula based on the sum of cubes, but it contained an error. The correct formula for the sum of cubes of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is not as previously described. Instead, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers cubed is simply the cube of the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers. This is due to the mathematical identity:

\[ (1^3 + 3^3 + 5^3 + \ldots + (2n-1)^3) = (n \times n)^2 = (n^2)^2 \]

Let's correct the implementation and provide the appropriate unit tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n):
    """
    Computes the cube sum of the first n odd natural numbers.
    
    The sum of the first n odd natural numbers cubed can be represented as:
    (n^2)^2 because the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2 
    and we are summing the cubes.
    :param n: the number of initial odd numbers to sum cubes of
    :return: the sum of cubes of the first n odd numbers
    """
    return (n * n) ** 2

from solution import solution

def test_solution_small_numbers():
    assert solution(1) == 1**3
    assert solution(2) == 1**3 + 3**3
    assert solution(3) == 1**3 + 3**3 + 5**3

def test_solution_zero():
    assert solution(0) == 0

def test_solution_single():
    assert solution(1) == 1  # (1^2)^2 simplifies to 1

def test_solution_large_numbers():
    n = 1000
    assert solution(n) == n**4
    n = 10000
    assert solution(n) == n**4

def test_solution_edge_cases():
    # Edge where formula and manual calculation must match
    for n in range(1, 100):
        assert solution(n) == sum((2*k-1)**3 for k in range(1, n+1))

### Explanation:
1. **Solution**: The corrected formula uses a known identity for sum of cubes of first \( n \) odd natural numbers. This identity ensures accurate results with constant time complexity \( O(1) \).

2. **Tests**: The unit tests verify correctness against small numbers, edge cases, and large numbers, ensuring the function aligns with expected mathematical properties.
