QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of integers and a dictionary, where each key is an integer and its value is the factorial of that integer. Replace each integer in the list with the first digit of its factorial using the dictionary for factorial values and then check if the resulting sequence has zero profit or zero loss when viewed as a series of transactions. Implement the factorial calculation with recursion and ensure that the transformation is applied using the map function where applicable. Return `True` if the sequence represents zero profit or zero loss, otherwise return `False`.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issue with the current solution lies in the recursive calculation of the factorial for negative numbers, which leads to a "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error. To address this, we must ensure the function handles negative inputs appropriately. 

Let's modify the solution and tests accordingly by restricting the factorial calculation to only non-negative integers and correcting the test cases to reflect valid operations.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

def first_digit(n):
    while n >= 10:
        n //= 10
    return n

def solution(lst, factorials):
    try:
        transformed_list = list(map(
            lambda x: first_digit(factorials.get(x, factorial(x))), lst))
        total = sum(transformed_list)
        return total == 0
    except ValueError:
        return False
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
import pytest
from solution import solution, factorial

def test_zero_profit_loss_all_zeros():
    input_list = [1, 1]
    factorials = {1: factorial(1)}  # [1, 1]
    assert solution(input_list, factorials) == False  # Total is 2, not zero

def test_zero_profit_loss_mixed():
    input_list = [3, 5, 3, 5]
    factorials = {3: factorial(3), 5: factorial(5)}
    assert solution(input_list, factorials) == False  # [6, 1, 6, 1] -> Total is 14, not zero

def test_zero_profit_loss_pos_only():
    input_list = [3, 5, 1]
    factorials = {3: factorial(3), 5: factorial(5), 1: factorial(1)}
    assert solution(input_list, factorials) == False  # Total is not zero

def test_zero_profit_loss_empty_list():
    assert solution([], {}) == True  # Empty list should trivially be zero profit/loss

def test_zero_profit_loss_single_zero():
    input_list = [0]
    factorials = {0: factorial(0)}
    assert solution(input_list, factorials) == True  # Total is zero

def test_zero_profit_loss_symmetric_even():
    input_list = [3, 3, 1, 1, 5, 5]
    factorials = {3: factorial(3), 1: factorial(1), 5: factorial(5)}
    assert solution(input_list, factorials) == False  # [6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1] Total is 16, not zero

# Checking error handling for negative numbers
def test_factorial_negative():
    input_list = [-1, -2]
    factorials = {}
    assert solution(input_list, factorials) == False  # Factorial doesn't exist for negatives
<|Test End|>
```

In this update, we ensured:

- The `factorial` function is restricted to non-negative numbers and raises a ValueError for negative input.
- The `solution` function now gracefully handles the potential of grabbing a missing key from the dictionary, stipulating sanity in list processing and computing totals grounded on valid factorial inputs.
- Tests are adjusted to reflect valid sequence manipulation, explicitly as it handles valid/invalid input ranges, aiming at semantic correctness and robustness.
