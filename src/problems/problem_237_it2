QUESTION

Original Question: Write a Python function to left rotate the bits of a given number.

New Question: Write a Python function to left rotate the bits of a given number by a specified number of positions, and ensure it works correctly for both positive and negative integers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The solution code accidentally includes unnecessary triple quotes around the code, causing syntax errors. Let's correct this issue, then provide a clean implementation and accompanying tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(number, bits, width=32):
    """
    Left rotates the bits of the given number by the specified number of positions.
    
    :param number: The integer whose bits are to be rotated, can be positive or negative.
    :param bits: The number of bit positions to rotate to the left.
    :param width: The bit width to consider for the rotation operation.
    :return: The integer result of left rotating the bits of the input number.
    """
    # Normalize the number of rotations to stay within the bit width
    bits = bits % width
    
    # Create a two's complement value for negative numbers
    if number < 0:
        number = (1 << width) + number
    
    # Perform the rotation
    rotated_number = ((number << bits) | (number >> (width - bits))) & ((1 << width) - 1)
    
    # Convert back to signed integer if necessary
    if rotated_number & (1 << (width - 1)):
        rotated_number = rotated_number - (1 << width)
    
    return rotated_number
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_positive_number():
    assert solution(28, 2) == 112  # 28 is 11100, rotate left by 2 -> 1110000 (112 in decimal)
    assert solution(5, 1) == 10    # 5 is 101, rotate left by 1 -> 1010 (10 in decimal)

def test_solution_large_rotation():
    assert solution(9, 8) == 9  # rotating the number of bits equal to 8, 9 is 1001 -> 00001001 (same as 9)
    assert solution(1, 32) == 1  # rotating a whole cycle for 32 bits, 1 is 000...0001 -> same as 1

def test_solution_negative_number():
    # Assuming 32 bit width, -2 is represented as 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111110
    # Rotate left by 1: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111101 -> -3 in two's complement
    assert solution(-2, 1) == -3

    # -8 is 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000
    # Rotate left by 2: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11100011 -> -29
    assert solution(-8, 2) == -29

def test_solution_zero():
    assert solution(0, 2) == 0  # Zero remains zero after any rotation

def test_solution_rotation_amount():
    n = 57
    assert solution(n, 32) == n  # Rotation by 32 results in the same number
    assert solution(n, 64) == n  # Rotation by a multiple of 32 should result in the same number
```

These modifications solve the syntax issues and ensure that the function executes correctly for the intended range of test cases.
