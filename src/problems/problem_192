Write a Python function to count the number of lists in a given nested list structure, including counting lists within the nested lists themselves.

SOL & TESTS

<|Solution Begin|> 
```python
def count_lists(nested_list):
    """
    Count the number of lists in the provided nested list structure.
    """
    if not isinstance(nested_list, list):
        return 0
    
    count = 1  # The current list itself.
    for element in nested_list:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            count += count_lists(element)
    return count
```
