QUESTION

Write a function that takes two lists of numbers and a single string. The function should return a new list of tuples. Each tuple should contain:

1. The index of the element.
2. The sum of the elements at that index from the two lists.
3. The string concatenated with "Divisible" or "Not Divisible" depending on whether the sum from point 2 is divisible by the length of the string.

If the lists differ in length, only process up to the length of the shorter list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's go through the solution and the provided tests to identify and correct the issues.

### Identified Issues:
1. **Division by Zero:** The code does not handle the case where the input string `s` has a length of zero, which leads to a division by zero error.
2. **Incorrect Expected Results:** Some tests have incorrect expected values, likely due to mistakes in understanding the divisibility logic and format.

We'll fix these issues by:
- Adding a condition to handle when string `s` is empty, preventing division by zero.
- Ensuring that expected values in test cases are aligned correctly with the problem statement.

### Updated Solution and Tests:

The above changes address the division by zero error and ensure the logic for divisibility is correctly implemented and tested.
