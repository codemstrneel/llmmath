QUESTION

Write a Python function to find the cube sum of the first n odd natural numbers, and also ensure the function handles the case where n is a large number efficiently, considering both time and space complexity.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Below is the solution to the problem and the corresponding unit tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n):
    """
    Computes the cube sum of the first n odd natural numbers.
    
    This can be done using the formula for the sum of cubes of the first n numbers:
    (1^3 + 3^3 + 5^3 + ... + (2n-1)^3) = (n^2 * (2n)^2) / 4
    
    :param n: the number of initial odd numbers to sum cubes of
    :return: the sum of cubes of the first n odd numbers
    """
    return (n**2 * (2 * n)**2) // 4
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_solution_small_numbers():
    assert solution(1) == 1**3
    assert solution(2) == 1**3 + 3**3
    assert solution(3) == 1**3 + 3**3 + 5**3

def test_solution_zero():
    assert solution(0) == 0

def test_solution_single():
    assert solution(1) == 1

def test_solution_large_numbers():
    assert solution(1000) == sum(k**3 for k in range(1, 2 * 1000, 2))
    assert solution(10000) == sum(k**3 for k in range(1, 2 * 10000, 2))

def test_solution_edge_cases():
    # Edge where formula and manual calculation must match
    for n in range(1, 100):
        assert solution(n) == sum((2*k-1)**3 for k in range(1, n+1))
<|Test End|>

### Explanation:
1. **Solution**: The function calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` odd numbers efficiently using a direct formula based on mathematical derivation. The time complexity is O(1) due to direct formula application.

2. **Tests**: The unit tests verify the function correctness over small inputs, zero input, large inputs, and a range of edge cases ensuring the formula's accuracy aligns with expected cubing behavior.
