QUESTION

**Combined Question:**

Write a Python function that accepts three inputs: a list of tuples `pairs`, two lists of integers `range1` and `range2`, and a string `input_string`. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify the longest chain of pairs from the given list `pairs`, similar to Question 2. A chain is defined such that for each pair `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` in the chain, `b` must be less than `c`.

2. From the longest chain identified, select pairs that define index ranges within `input_string`. For each valid pair `(start, end)` in the chain, extract a subsequence from `input_string` starting at index `start` and ending at index `end`, ensuring these subsequences do not overlap in the string. Return a list of these subsequences while maintaining their order of appearance in `input_string`.

3. Combine the two integer lists `range1` and `range2` into a single list without overlapping elements, as in Question 3. Ensure the resulting list maintains the unique elements while preserving the order of first appearance from either list.

For example, given:

- `pairs = [(0, 1), (3, 5), (6, 9), (2, 4)]`, the longest chain of non-overlapping pairs is `[(0, 1), (3, 5), (6, 9)]`.
- `range1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `range2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]`, the combined list without duplicates is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- `input_string = "hello world!"`, use the longest chain to extract subsequences corresponding to index ranges in `input_string`.

Thus, the function should return the subsequences derived from the chain and the combined list. The function's tasks emphasize working with data structures, string slicing, and maintaining non-overlapping properties.
