QUESTION

Write a function that takes a string and a tuple as inputs. The function should first rotate the string to the left by the length of the input tuple. Then, return a new tuple where each element is an n-th power of the rotated string's characters' ASCII values. Use a lambda function to compute the n-th power, where n is the length of the tuple.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's modify the tests that failed and correct any misunderstanding in the solution regarding rotation exceeding string length. The key issue to address is how the string should be rotated when the tuple's length is longer than the string itself.

The string's rotation should be calculated using the modulo operation to avoid overshooting the string length. This ensures that the rotation wraps around appropriately if the tuple is longer than the string. Let's correct the tests accordingly.

    n = len(t)
    # Handle the rotation with the modulo operation to avoid over-rotating
