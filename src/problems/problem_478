QUESTION

New Question: Write a Python function to determine if the roots of a quadratic equation are rational numbers and if the difference between the coefficients a, b, and c is consistent.

SOL & TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to determine two things for a quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\):

1. Whether the roots of the equation are rational.
2. If the difference between the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is consistent (e.g., follows a specific pattern).

### Determining Rational Roots

To determine if the roots of a quadratic equation are rational, we can use the discriminant, \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). The roots are rational if \(\Delta\) is a perfect square.

### Consistency in Coefficients

For the purpose of this solution, I will define "consistent differences" as the differences between the absolute values of consecutive coefficients being constant, i.e., \(|a-b| = |b-c|\).

Hereâ€™s the solution:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def is_rational_and_consistent(a, b, c):
    """
    Determines if the roots of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 are rational
    and if the difference between the coefficients a, b, and c is consistent.
    
    Returns a tuple (roots_rational, coefficients_consistent).
    """
    from math import isqrt
    
    # Calculate the discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    
    # Check if the discriminant is a perfect square
    roots_rational = discriminant >= 0 and isqrt(discriminant) ** 2 == discriminant
    
    # Check if |a-b| == |b-c|
    coefficients_consistent = abs(a - b) == abs(b - c)
    
    return roots_rational, coefficients_consistent
```

    assert is_rational_and_consistent(1, 2, 1) == (True, True)  # Roots are -1 (double root), coefficients consistent.
    assert is_rational_and_consistent(2, 3, 1) == (True, True)  # Roots are -0.5 and -1, consistent differences
    assert is_rational_and_consistent(2, 3, 3) == (False, True) # Non-rational roots, but differences consistent.

    assert is_rational_and_consistent(2, -3, 1) == (False, False) # Non-rational roots, differences not consistent.

def test_edge_cases():
    assert is_rational_and_consistent(0, 0, 0) == (True, True) # Degenerate case, roots are undefined but valid.
    assert is_rational_and_consistent(0, 0, 1) == (False, False) # c != 0, no roots, differences not consistent.
    assert is_rational_and_consistent(1, 0, 0) == (True, False) # One root at 0, differences not consistent.
    assert is_rational_and_consistent(0, 1, -1) == (True, True) # Linear equation, root 1, consistent differences.
