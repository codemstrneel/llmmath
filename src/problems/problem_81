QUESTION

Here is a novel question that integrates core concepts from the provided questions:

**New Question:**

Write a function that takes a list which contains both strings and tuples of floating-point numbers, along with an additional sorted array. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **String Processing**: For each string in the list, check if it contains balanced brackets (parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces). If balanced, identify and extract any sequence that follows the pattern '(c...d)' where 'c' and 'd' are lowercase letters, and return these sequences. If unbalanced, indicate this with an error message.

2. **Tuple Processing**: Each tuple contains a series of floating-point numbers. For each tuple, identify sublists where consecutive numbers differ by more than a threshold. Compute the median for these sublists, and for each median, insert it into the given sorted array without altering the order of the existing numbers.

3. **Integration**: For every tuple associated with a balanced string, adjust all its floating-point numbers by adding the number of pattern sequences found in that string. If the string is unbalanced, retain the original tuple values.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- A list of results for each string (either error messages or extracted sequences).
- A list of adjusted tuples for each series of floating-point numbers.
- A final sorted array with all medians inserted.

This question combines aspects of regex pattern matching, balanced bracket checking, floating-point arithmetic, median calculation, and array manipulation within the context of mixed data processing.
