QUESTION

Create a Python function that accepts a string and a non-negative integer n as inputs. The function should first replace sequences of consecutive vowels in the string with a single underscore using regular expressions. Then, depending on the number of underscores introduced, if this count is a multiple of 3, calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Otherwise, return the sum of all unique numbers in the row specified by n in a matrix (assume the matrix and integer n are such that valid calculations can be made based on the input string processing).
