QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a positive integer `m` and a list of integers as input. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each integer `k` in the list, if `k` is equal to its 1-based index in the list, replace `k` with the left-rotated sum of the factorials of numbers from 1 to `k`.
2. After processing all such cases, return the sum of the squares of all the modified elements in the list.

This problem combines the factorial calculation from Question 1, the fixed point concept and bit rotation from Question 4, and the sum of squares from Question 2.
