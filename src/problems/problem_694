QUESTION

Write a Python function to count the number of spheres of radius r that can fit inside a sphere of radius R, assuming both spheres are perfectly packed without any gaps.

SOL & TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many smaller spheres of radius `r` can fit into a larger sphere of radius `R`. One effective approach is to use packing density ratios. The packing density of spheres is the proportion of space filled when spheres are packed as tightly as possible. For spheres, the packing density is approximately 0.74, assuming a face-centered cubic packing arrangement.

Given this, the total volume occupied by the smaller spheres can be calculated as 74% of the larger sphere's volume (to reflect the packing density). We can then compute how many smaller spheres fit by dividing the total occupied volume by the volume of a single smaller sphere.

The volume `V` of a sphere of radius `r` is given by the formula:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

Using this, the volume of the larger sphere of radius `R` is:

\[ V_{large} = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \]

The volume occupied by the smaller spheres is `0.74 * V_{large}`, and each sphere has a volume `V_{small} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3`. The number of smaller spheres is therefore:

\[ N = \left\lfloor \frac{0.74 * V_{large}}{V_{small}} \right\rfloor \]

where `⎣ ⎦` denotes flooring (or integer part) since we cannot have a fractional number of spheres.

Here’s how we can implement this in Python.

```python
import math

def count_spheres(R, r):
    """
    Returns the number of smaller spheres of radius r
    that can fit into a larger sphere of radius R.
    """
    if r <= 0 or R <= 0 or r > R:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate volumes
    volume_large = (4/3) * math.pi * R**3
    volume_small = (4/3) * math.pi * r**3
    
    # Calculate the number of small spheres that can fit
    packing_density = 0.74
    max_volume_occupied_by_smalls = packing_density * volume_large
    number_of_spheres = max_volume_occupied_by_smalls // volume_small
    
    return int(number_of_spheres)
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import count_spheres

def test_exact_fit():
    assert count_spheres(1, 1) == 0

def test_no_fit():
    assert count_spheres(5, 6) == 0

def test_single_small_sphere():
    assert count_spheres(5, 5) == 0

def test_small_radius_case():
    assert count_spheres(10, 1) > 0

def test_large_radius_case():
    assert count_spheres(100, 10) > 0

def test_zero_radius():
    assert count_spheres(0, 1) == 0
    assert count_spheres(1, 0) == 0

def test_negative_radius():
    assert count_spheres(-5, 1) == 0
    assert count_spheres(5, -1) == 0

def test_large_vs_small_ratio():
    assert count_spheres(10, 1) > 0
    assert count_spheres(100, 1) > count_spheres(10, 1)
```
<|Test End|>

This solution assumes that the radii are positive and fits the smaller sphere entirely within the larger one (excluding edge-contact cases).
