QUESTION

Create a Python function that takes a tuple of integers and a sentence as input. The function should perform the following operations:

1. Calculate the product of all the numbers in the given tuple.
2. If the product is odd, convert the sentence such that:
   - Check if the sentence starts with 'a' and contains zero or more 'b's immediately following it.
   - If the sentence satisfies this condition, compute the sum of ASCII values of all characters in the sentence. If this sum falls within a specified numeric range, return the length of the sentence; otherwise, return the ASCII sum.
   - If the sentence does not satisfy the initial condition, count the number of vowels and replace every occurrence of the word 'road' with 'rd.' Return the modified sentence after substitutions, or the length of the sentence when the ASCII sum condition is met.
3. If the product is even, treat each digit of the product as a character and check if it appears as an alternating character substring within the given sentence. If so, create a new list consisting of these digits and return them as integers.

This novel problem integrates number property checking using bitwise operations, tuple operations for calculating a product, conditional logic with string operations based on regular expressions, and specific character pattern searching within a sentence.
