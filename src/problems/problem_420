QUESTION

Given the set of coding questions you've provided, I'll combine core concepts from questions 1, 3, and 4 to create a new question that incorporates text analysis, integer sequence identification, and frequency counting.

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes two arguments: a list of text snippets and a list of integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Analyze the list of text snippets to identify each unique word and return a dictionary where each word is a key. The value should be a tuple containing the frequency of that word across all snippets and the earliest text snippet index where the word appears.

2. In the list of integers, identify all sequences of consecutive numbers (e.g., in the list [3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6], the sequences are [3, 4, 5] and [2, 3, 4]) and return the longest such sequence. If there are ties in length, return the first occurring sequence.

3. Find the most frequent word in the combined text snippets and the most frequent integer in the list of numbers, returning a tuple with both these elements and their respective counts.

The function should return a tuple containing the word frequency dictionary, the longest sequence of consecutive integers, and a tuple with the most frequent word and integer along with their frequencies.
