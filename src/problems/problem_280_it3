QUESTION

Write a Python function to evaluate the discriminant of a quadratic equation.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears there were compilation errors due to incorrect formatting of the solution and test sections. Let's fix the formatted sections and ensure correct syntax to avoid these issues. We'll do so by correctly providing a Python function and its tests in the specified format.

Make sure to include the `import` of the solution inside the tests, as it helps run the tests independently.

Here's the corrected version:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(a, b, c):
    """
    Evaluates the discriminant of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
    
    Parameters:
    a (float): The coefficient of x^2.
    b (float): The coefficient of x.
    c (float): The constant term.
    
    Returns:
    float: The discriminant of the quadratic equation.
    """
    return b**2 - 4*a*c
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_discriminant_positive():
    # Test where the discriminant is positive, meaning two distinct real roots
    assert solution(1, -3, 2) == 1  # D = (-3)^2 - 4*1*2 = 9 - 8 = 1

def test_discriminant_zero():
    # Test where the discriminant is zero, meaning two equal real roots
    assert solution(1, 2, 1) == 0  # D = 2^2 - 4*1*1 = 4 - 4 = 0

def test_discriminant_negative():
    # Test where the discriminant is negative, meaning two complex roots
    assert solution(1, 0, 1) == -4  # D = 0^2 - 4*1*1 = -4

def test_discriminant_large_coefficients():
    # Test with large coefficients
    assert solution(1000, 5000, 2000) == (5000**2 - 4*1000*2000)  # Calculating manually

def test_discriminant_zero_coefficients():
    # Test with zero coefficients resulting in any form
    assert solution(0, 2, 1) == 4  # D = 2^2 = 4 when a=0, it's not a quadratic but we test the discriminant anyway
    assert solution(1, 0, 0) == 0  # D = 0^2 - 4*1*0 = 0
```
<|Test End|>

This implementation should now be correctly formatted.
