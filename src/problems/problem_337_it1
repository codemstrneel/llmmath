QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and checks if replacing the first digit of each number with the first digit of its factorial results in an increasing sequence. Use recursion to calculate factorials and map function to apply the transformation to each number in the list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears that while the tests themselves are structurally correct, there was an error indicating that the `replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit` function is not defined. This likely indicates an issue with the test script accessing the solution code. To rectify, I will ensure that the test suite can correctly interact with the solution functions by making sure all functions are accessible which usually requires importing them properly during testing. 

I will include imports for both `replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit` and `solution` functions within the test code.

Here is the revised solution and test suite:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Recursively calculates the factorial of a given number n.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

def replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(number):
    """
    Replaces the first digit of the input number with the first digit
    of the factorial of the number.
    """
    str_number = str(number)
    first_digit_factorial = factorial(int(str_number[0]))
    first_digit_of_factorial = str(first_digit_factorial)[0]
    new_number = first_digit_of_factorial + str_number[1:]
    return int(new_number)

def solution(numbers):
    """
    Transforms each number in the list by replacing its first digit with the
    first digit of its factorial and checks if the resulting sequence is strictly increasing.
    """
    transformed_numbers = list(map(replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit, numbers))
    return all(earlier < later for earlier, later in zip(transformed_numbers, transformed_numbers[1:]))
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit, solution

def test_replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit():
    assert replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(23) == 63
    assert replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(89) == 49  # factorial of 8 is 40320, first digit is 4
    assert replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(412) == 212  # factorial of 4 is 24, first digit is 2

def test_solution_increasing_sequence():
    assert solution([23, 45, 67]) == True  # first digit factorials: (6, 24, 720) -> transform: 63, 45, 67
    assert solution([12, 45, 122]) == True  # first digit factorials: (1, 24, 720) -> transform: 12, 45, 122

def test_solution_non_increasing_sequence():
    assert solution([321, 45, 4]) == False  # (first digit factorials: 6, 24, 24) -> transform: 621, 45, 4
    assert solution([23, 22, 21]) == False  # (first digit factorials: 6, 2, 2) -> transform: 63, 22, 21

def test_solution_edge_cases():
    assert solution([1]) == True  # single element is considered increasing
    assert solution([2, 0]) == False  # 2 -> 2, 0 factorial is 1 -> 1, not increasing
```
<|Test End|>

This updated test suite is properly importing necessary functions from the solution and should now be capable of executing correctly.
