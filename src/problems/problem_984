QUESTION

To create a new coding question that combines elements from the given problems, I will integrate concepts such as processing tuples and lists, comparing elements, filtering with conditions, and computing a statistical measure.

---

**New Question:**

Create a Python function `analyze_string_numbers` that receives a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three elements: a number, a list of strings, and another number. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify the tuple where the sum of the first and third elements (both are numbers) is the maximum among all tuples.
2. Use a lambda function to filter the tuples where the product of the first and third elements is divisible by a given number \( m \).
3. For the tuples that pass this filter, count the number of strings that begin and end with the same character.
4. Calculate the average length of strings for each filtered tuple.
5. Return a tuple containing:
   - The tuple with the maximum sum of the first and third elements.
   - A list of counts representing how many strings start and end with the same character for each filtered tuple.
   - A list of average string lengths for each filtered tuple.

Make sure your function handles edge cases where the list may be empty, or tuples might include `None` values, ensuring that all arithmetic and string operations involve only valid and appropriate elements.

This problem blends tuple manipulation, conditional filtering, string processing, arithmetic comparisons, and the computation of an average, incorporating elements from string handling, arithmetic operations, and list processing.

```python
def analyze_string_numbers(tuples_list, m):
    """
    Analyzes a list of tuples based on specific criteria.

    Each tuple contains a number, a list of strings, and another number. The function
    returns a tuple with:
    1. The tuple where the sum of the first and third elements is the maximum.
    2. A list of counts of strings that start and end with the same character for filtered tuples.
    3. A list of average string lengths for each filtered tuple.

    Args:
    tuples_list (list of tuples): Each tuple contains (number, list of strings, number).
    m (int): The divisor for filtering tuples based on product divisibility.

    Returns:
    tuple: (tuple with max sum, list of counts, list of average lengths)

    def count_same_char_strings(strings):
        """Counts strings that start and end with the same character."""
        return sum(1 for s in strings if len(s) > 0 and s[0] == s[-1])

    def average_length(strings):
        """Calculates the average length of the strings."""
        logged_lengths = [len(s) for s in strings]
        return sum(logged_lengths) / len(logged_lengths) if logged_lengths else 0

    if not tuples_list:
        return (None, [], [])

    # Find tuple with the maximum sum of the first and third elements
    max_tuple = max(tuples_list, key=lambda x: (x[0] or 0) + (x[2] or 0))

    # Filter tuples by product divisibility
    filtered_tuples = list(filter(lambda x: (x[0] or 0) * (x[2] or 0) % m == 0, tuples_list))

    # Generate result lists for counts of strings and average lengths
    counts = [count_same_char_strings(t[1]) for t in filtered_tuples]
    averages = [average_length(t[1]) for t in filtered_tuples]
