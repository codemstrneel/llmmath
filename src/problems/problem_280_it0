QUESTION

Write a Python function to evaluate the discriminant of a quadratic equation.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve the problem, we need to write a Python function that computes the discriminant of a quadratic equation. The discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic equation given in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is calculated using the formula:

\[ D = b^2 - 4ac \]

The discriminant helps determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation.

Let's implement this solution and write unit tests for it.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(a, b, c):
    """
    Evaluates the discriminant of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
    
    Parameters:
    a (float): The coefficient of x^2.
    b (float): The coefficient of x.
    c (float): The constant term.
    
    Returns:
    float: The discriminant of the quadratic equation.
    """
    return b**2 - 4*a*c
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_discriminant_positive():
    # Test where the discriminant is positive, meaning two distinct real roots
    assert solution(1, -3, 2) == 1  # D = (-3)^2 - 4*1*2 = 9 - 8 = 1

def test_discriminant_zero():
    # Test where the discriminant is zero, meaning two equal real roots
    assert solution(1, 2, 1) == 0  # D = 2^2 - 4*1*1 = 4 - 4 = 0

def test_discriminant_negative():
    # Test where the discriminant is negative, meaning two complex roots
    assert solution(1, 0, 1) == -4  # D = 0^2 - 4*1*1 = -4

def test_discriminant_large_coefficients():
    # Test with large coefficients
    assert solution(1000, 5000, 2000) == (5000**2 - 4*1000*2000)  # Calculating manually

def test_discriminant_zero_coefficients():
    # Test with zero coefficients resulting in any form
    assert solution(0, 2, 1) == 4  # D = 2^2 = 4 when a=0, it's not a quadratic but we test the discriminant anyway
    assert solution(1, 0, 0) == 0  # D = 0^2 - 4*1*0 = 0
```

These tests are crafted to verify the behavior of the discriminant calculation function across several scenarios that a user might expect, ensuring the function's robustness and correctness.
