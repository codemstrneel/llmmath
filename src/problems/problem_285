QUESTION

Here is a novel coding question that combines core concepts from Questions 2, 3, and 5:

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes a list of strings and an integer `n` as inputs. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each string in the list, reverse the order of the characters.
2. Check each reversed string to ensure it is composed solely of the same character, and if so, form a new list containing those strings.
3. For each string in this new list of same-character strings, calculate the length of the string and find the index of the smallest triangular number that is equal to this length.
4. Return a dictionary where the keys are the original strings (not reversed), and the values are a tuple containing the reversed string and the smallest triangular number index if the string was composed of the same character, or `None` if not.

**Example:**

```python
def process_strings(strings, n):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Sample Input
strings = ["aaaa", "bbb", "ccc", "abc", "dddddd"]
n = 7

# Sample Output
# {
#   "aaaa": ("aaaa", 3),    # Length 4 <- Smallest triangular with length 4 is 3 (3rd index)
#   "bbb": ("bbb", 2),      # Length 3 <- Smallest triangular with length 3 is 2 (2nd index)
#   "ccc": ("ccc", 2),      # Length 3 <- Smallest triangular with length 3 is 2 (2nd index)
#   "abc": ("cba", None),   # Not same character string
#   "dddddd": ("dddddd", None) # Larger than n
# }

output = process_strings(strings, n)
print(output)
```

In this problem, you will apply techniques from string manipulation (reversing and checking for uniform characters), index finding, and mathematical computations involving triangular numbers.
