QUESTION

Write a function that accepts a dictionary and a target integer. The function should first check if the target integer is present as a key in the dictionary. If it is, calculate the product of all the keys in the dictionary. Then, determine if the product is a fixed point within the given list of keys. A fixed point here is defined as an index in the list where the index value is equal to the list element itself. Return the fixed point if it exists; otherwise, return a message stating there is no fixed point. If the target integer is not present as a key, return a message indicating so.
