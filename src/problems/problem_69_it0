QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of pairs of integers and returns the kth element of a new list formed by adding the sum of each pair's integers to separate lists based on whether the sums are odd or even. First, construct one list of odd sums and another list of even sums, then merge them to place the odd sums before the even sums, and finally return the kth element from this merged list.
