QUESTION

Write a function that determines if one array is a permutation of a subset of another array, ensuring that the subset elements appear in the same relative order as they do in the main array. If this condition is met, return the starting index of such a subset in the larger array; otherwise, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to determine if one array is a permutation of a subset of another array, with the additional constraint that elements in the subset must appear in the same order as they do in the main array. If this is the case, we should return the starting index of such a subset in the main array; otherwise, we should return -1.

Here's how to implement it:

1. Iterate through every possible starting point of the main list where the subset could match the length of the sub array.
2. For each starting position, verify if the current window in the main array is a permutation of the sub array.
3. If a match is found, return the starting index of the subset.
4. If no such subset is found, return -1.

Below is the implementation of the solution to the problem and the corresponding unit tests.
