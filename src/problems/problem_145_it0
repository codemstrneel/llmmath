QUESTION

Write a function that identifies whether the sequence of unique profit elements from one array exists as a contiguous subsequence in another array. If it does, return the gcd of the first subsequence of such unique profit elements found; otherwise, return None. Elements in the "profit array" are assumed to have a "profit" if they are positive.

SOLUTION/TESTS

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
from math import gcd
from typing import List, Optional

def solution(profit: List[int], sequence: List[int]) -> Optional[int]:
    # Extract the unique positive elements from the profit array
    unique_profit_elements = list(set(filter(lambda x: x > 0, profit)))
    
    # Check if unique_profit_elements is a contiguous subsequence in sequence
    n, m = len(sequence), len(unique_profit_elements)
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        if sequence[i:i+m] == unique_profit_elements:
            # Calculate gcd of the first subsequence of unique elements found
            return gcd_of_list(unique_profit_elements)
    
    return None

def gcd_of_list(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    result = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers[1:]:
        result = gcd(result, number)
    return result
