QUESTION

Develop a function that determines the most frequent characters and their respective frequencies in a provided string, disregarding any characters that are specified in a given exclusion list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues with the failing tests. The failures indicate a problem with either the solution or the test cases for partial exclusions and frequency count. Let's first review and resolve these issues:

1. **`test_frequent_with_exclusions_partial`:** The test expects "r", "c", and "d" to be the most frequent after exclusions, but they all have different frequencies. The test should assert only the most frequent character(s). Let's assume the solution is expected to find the highest count only.

2. **`test_frequent_no_exclusions`:** It should correctly identify the most frequent character or characters. If there is only one most frequent count, the test should reflect that.

Let's fix the test cases to align expected outcomes with how the most frequent characters are determined.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(s, exclusion_list):
    """
    Determines the most frequent characters in a string s, excluding characters in exclusion_list.
    
    Args:
    - s (str): The input string to analyze.
    - exclusion_list (list): A list of characters to exclude from consideration.
    
    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary with the most frequent characters (after exclusion) as keys, and their frequencies as values.
    """
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Convert the string to lowercase to count frequencies without case sensitivity
    s = s.lower()

    # Create a dictionary to count frequency of each character
    frequency = defaultdict(int)

    # Populate the frequency dictionary, excluding characters in the exclusion list
    for char in s:
        if char not in exclusion_list:
            frequency[char] += 1

    # Find the highest frequency
    if not frequency:
        return {}

    max_freq = max(frequency.values())
    
    # Create a dictionary of most frequent characters with their respective frequencies
    most_frequent = {char: count for char, count in frequency.items() if count == max_freq}
    
    return most_frequent
<|Solution End|>
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_frequent_with_exclusions():
    assert solution("hello world", [" "]) == {"l": 3}

def test_frequent_with_exclusions_partial():
    assert solution("abracadabra", ["a", "b"]) == {"r": 2}

def test_frequent_no_exclusions():
    assert solution("banana", []) == {"a": 3}

def test_frequent_with_full_exclusion():
    assert solution("python", ["p", "y", "t", "h", "o", "n"]) == {}

def test_empty_string():
    assert solution("", ["a", "b", "c"]) == {}

def test_no_frequent_characters_due_to_exclusion():
    assert solution("mississippi", ["m", "i", "s", "p"]) == {}

def test_frequent_with_numbers():
    assert solution("112233445566", ["1", "2"]) == {"3": 2, "4": 2, "5": 2, "6": 2}

def test_frequent_case_insensitivity():
    assert solution("AaBbCc", ["b"]) == {"a": 2, "c": 2}
    
<|Test End|>

I have corrected one of the tests to reflect the intent that it finds the most frequent remaining character(s) given exclusions. Now they should accurately test the solution's ability to identify the most frequently occurring characters post-exclusion.
