QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a sorted list and a dictionary representing a series of numbers, where one number is repeated in the list but not in the dictionary. Additionally, the function should also take a string as input. The function should return a tuple containing two elements: the repeated number in the list and a new string with all numeric characters moved to the end, preserving their order. Use a combination of bitwise operations and recursion to identify the repeated number.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two tasks: 
1. Identify the repeated number in the sorted list using a bitwise comparison technique alongside recursion.
2. Rearrange the input string such that numeric characters are moved to the end while preserving the order of the characters.

Here is the solution with implementation details:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(sorted_list, num_dict, input_string):
    """
    Identifies the repeated number in a sorted list and reorders a string
    by moving numeric characters to the end.
    
    sorted_list : list : A list of sorted numbers, one of which is repeated
    num_dict : dict : A dictionary where keys are the numbers in the list (without repetition)
    input_string : str : The input string that needs reordering
    
    Returns a tuple (repeated_number, reordered_string).
    """
    
    # Function to find the repeated number in the list using recursion and bitwise manipulation
    def find_repeated_num(lst, left, right):
        if left == right:
            return lst[left]
        
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        # Use a bitwise technique to determine which half contains the repetition
        if mid < len(lst) - 1 and lst[mid] == lst[mid + 1]:
            return lst[mid]
        if mid > 0 and lst[mid] == lst[mid - 1]:
            return lst[mid]
        
        # If the middle element is equal to its index + the smallest element, go right
        if lst[mid] == num_dict_keys[mid + left]:
            return find_repeated_num(lst, mid + 1, right)
        else:
            return find_repeated_num(lst, left, mid)
    
    num_dict_keys = sorted(num_dict.keys())
    repeated_number = find_repeated_num(sorted_list, 0, len(sorted_list) - 1)
    
    # Rearrange the string
    letters = []
    numbers = []
    
    for char in input_string:
        if char.isdigit():
            numbers.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
            
    reordered_string = ''.join(letters + numbers)
    
    return (repeated_number, reordered_string)

The tests aim to verify that the `solution` function correctly handles different scenarios of input configurations, including repeated numbers at different positions in the list and various configurations of the input string.
