QUESTION

Write a Python function to determine the number of roots for a cubic equation.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issue with the implementation in the previous attempt was an unnecessary use of backticks for comments, which is not valid in Python. I will correct the solution syntax and ensure the function implementation can handle different cubic equation cases properly. I'll also revise the test cases to ensure accurate discrimination of roots based on already known cubic equations.

Here is the corrected implementation and tests in the specified format:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(a, b, c, d):
    """
    Determines the number of distinct real roots for a cubic equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0.
    The number of real roots is based on the discriminant of the cubic equation.
    """
    if a == 0:
        if b == 0:
            if c == 0:
                # No proper equation
                return float('inf') if d == 0 else 0
            else:
                # Linear equation cx + d = 0
                return 1
        else:
            # Quadratic equation bx^2 + cx + d = 0 -> Using the discriminant b^2 - 4ac
            delta_quad = c**2 - 4*b*d
            if delta_quad > 0:
                return 2
            elif delta_quad == 0:
                return 1
            else:
                return 0

    # Calculate the cubic discriminant
    delta = 18 * a * b * c * d - 4 * (b ** 3) * d + (b ** 2) * (c ** 2) - 4 * a * (c ** 3) - 27 * (a ** 2) * (d ** 2)

    if delta > 0:
        return 3  # Three distinct real roots
    elif delta == 0:
        return 2  # Triple root or one double and one distinct real root
    else:
        return 1  # One real root
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_three_distinct_real_roots():
    # For a cubic equation that typically has three real roots: x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0
    assert solution(1, -6, 11, -6) == 3

def test_solution_triple_root():
    # For x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0, which is derived with one repeated root
    assert solution(1, -3, 3, -1) == 2

def test_solution_double_and_single_root():
    # For a simplified case with a double root and a single root: x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0
    assert solution(1, -3, 3, -2) == 2

def test_solution_one_real_root():
    # A known complex root case, for example x^3 + x + 1 = 0
    assert solution(1, 0, 1, 1) == 1

def test_solution_no_cubic_terms():
    # Reduced to a quadratic equation: x^2 - 4 = 0
    assert solution(0, 1, 0, -4) == 2

def test_solution_edge_case_all_coefficients_zero():
    # All coefficients zero technically makes it zero = 0, which has infinite solutions
    assert solution(0, 0, 0, 0) == float('inf')
```
<|Test End|>

This implementation ensures that the function can determine the number of real roots of a cubic equation, even when specific coefficients reduce it to a simpler algebraic form like quadratic or linear. The tests are designed to validate this under various input conditions.
