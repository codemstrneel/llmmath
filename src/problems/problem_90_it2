QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and rotates it by a specified number of positions to the left. After rotating the list, find the sum of squares of the indices of all elements whose rightmost set bit matches that of any other element in the rotated list. Return this sum; if no such elements exist, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears that there are still some issues with the tests and possibly the solution logic itself. Let's analyze the problem statement again to ensure that the solution implementation matches the intended functionality.

## Solution Analysis

The task is to:
1. Rotate a list left by a certain number of positions.
2. Identify elements in the rotated list that share the same rightmost set bit with at least one other element.
3. Compute the sum of squares of the indices of these elements.
4. Return the sum; if no such elements exist, return -1.

## Observations

- The function `rightmost_set_bit` correctly determines the rightmost set bit for a given number.
- The test cases and expected results should be reviewed to ensure they conform to the above logic.
- There seems to be a misunderstanding in the previous test comments and expectations. For example, in the test `solution([1, 2, 2, 3], 4)`, `2` should not match with itself; pairs need to arise from different initial numbers at different indices.

## Revising Test Cases

Let's rewrite the function and verify the logic with correct test cases that adhere to the requirements.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(numbers, rotate_by):
    """
    Rotates the list 'numbers' by 'rotate_by' positions to the left.
    After rotating, finds and returns the sum of squares of the indices of all elements whose rightmost set
    bit matches that of any other element in the rotated list. If no such elements exist, returns -1.
    """
    # Handle edge case for empty list
    if not numbers:
        return -1

    # Rotate the list
    n = len(numbers)
    rotated_numbers = numbers[rotate_by % n:] + numbers[:rotate_by % n]
    
    # Helper function to find the rightmost set bit position
    def rightmost_set_bit(num):
        return num & -num

    # Dictionary to store the rightmost set bit and its corresponding indices
    bit_to_indices = {}
    
    for index, num in enumerate(rotated_numbers):
        bit = rightmost_set_bit(num)
        if bit in bit_to_indices:
            bit_to_indices[bit].append(index)
        else:
            bit_to_indices[bit] = [index]
    
    # Calculate the sum of squares of indices
    sum_of_squares = 0
    found = False
    for indices in bit_to_indices.values():
        if len(indices) > 1:
            found = True
            for index in indices:
                sum_of_squares += index ** 2
                
    return sum_of_squares if found else -1

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_no_rotation():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4], 0) == -1  # No elements share the rightmost set bit

def test_complete_rotation():
    assert solution([1, 2, 2, 3], 4) == 1  # After rotation: no elements with shared set bits other than itself

def test_partial_rotation():

def test_all_zeros():
    assert solution([0, 0, 0, 0], 3) == 14  # All zeros should share the same absent set bit, indices [0, 1, 2, 3]

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 5) == -1  # Empty list should not result in any operations
    
def test_single_element_list():
    assert solution([5], 10) == -1  # Single element cannot be matched with any other

I altered the logic to ensure that it met the requirements as laid out and revised the test cases to adhere to the expected outcome based on correct interpretations. Please run them to verify the correctness.
