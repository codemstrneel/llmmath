QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes in three arguments: a list of strings (phrases), a list of numbers (scores), and a threshold tuple for character frequency and sequence gaps (two positive integers). The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **Word and Character Frequency Analysis**: 
   - For each unique word across all phrases, construct a dictionary where each key is a word and the value is a dictionary containing:
     - "char_freq": the frequency of the most common character in this word across all phrases.
     - "word_appears_in_snippets": a count of how many phrases contain this word.
   - Exclude words where the most common character frequency is less than the character frequency threshold specified in the input tuple.

2. **Score Sequence and Gap Analysis**:
   - Identify if the scores list can be made consecutive by removing any single element from the start or end (only one removal allowed).
   - Determine the smallest missing number in the list of scores that creates a gap preventing it from being consecutive.
   - Only consider the resulting sequence valid if the smallest missing number is greater than the gap allowed specified in the threshold tuple.

3. **Score Duplicate and Consecutive Group Analysis**:
   - Remove duplicate scores from the list while maintaining the order of their first appearance.
   - Create a dictionary of scores where each key is a distinct number and the value is:
     - "consec_count": the number of distinct consecutive appearances of the number (e.g., [4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4] translates to consecutive groups [4, 5, 6, 4]).
   - Only retain scores where their "consec_count" is greater than the smallest missing number found in the previous step.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- The word frequency dictionary filtered by character frequency.
- A boolean indicating if the scores could be made consecutive by one removal.
- The smallest number causing a gap or `None` if not applicable.
- The processed list of scores with duplicates removed and the constructed dictionary for consecutive group analysis.

**Example:**

```python
def analyze_data(phrases, scores, thresholds):
    pass

phrases = ["apple pie", "banana apple pie", "cherry banana", "apple banana", "date pie"]
scores = [10, 11, 11, 13, 15, 12, 10, 14, 12]
thresholds = (2, 1)

result = analyze_data(phrases, scores, thresholds)

# Example Expected Output:
# ({
#    "apple": {"char_freq": 2, "word_appears_in_snippets": 3},
#    "banana": {"char_freq": 2, "word_appears_in_snippets": 3}
#  },
#  False,
#  16,
#  ([10, 11, 13, 15, 12, 14],
#   {
#     10: {"consec_count": 1},
#     11: {"consec_count": 1},
#     12: {"consec_count": 1}
#   })
# )
```

This question integrates string frequency analysis, sequence gap detection, and consecutive group processing, assembling ideas from multiple provided coding challenges.
