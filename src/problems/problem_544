QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of mixed data types and a number \( n \). The list contains combinations of integers, strings, and tuples of integers. The function should process the list through the following steps:

1. **Filtering Stage:** 
   - Remove any integers that are negative.
   - Remove any strings that contain an even number of characters.
   - Remove any tuples that contain any negative integer.

2. **Duplicate Detection Stage:**
   - Check for any remaining integers or tuples that occur at least twice and retain only one instance of these duplicates.

3. **Transformation and Grouping Stage:**
   - For each string left, rotate its characters left by \( n \) positions if the string length is greater than \( n \).
   - Group all rotated strings that are isomorphic to each other.

4. **Final Chunking and Aggregation Stage:**
   - Organize the resulting list into chunks of size \( n \). Any leftover elements that donâ€™t fill a complete chunk should be placed in their own chunk.
   - In each chunk, sort integers in descending order, followed by strings and then tuples of integers.
   - For each chunk, return a tuple with the sum of Unicode values of any remaining strings and the number of tuples; this should be repeated for each character in each tuple.

**Examples:**
- Given the list `["apple", "level", (3, 4), (6, -7), -8, 10, 10, "hello"]` and the number 2, the resultant process filters negatives and even-character strings, rotates the strings, groups them, chunks the list, and produces output based on specified calculations.
- With the list `[3, "mango", "banana", (2, 5), (1, 1, -1), (3, 5), "abc"]` and \( n \) as 3, process this list using the stages described to yield a result.

This novel problem combines several elements from your questions:

- From **Question 1**, it uses filtering based on conditions and operations like left rotation of strings.
- From **Question 3**, it features logic to find duplicates in the list.
- From **Question 2**, it integrates chunking elements to organize the processed list.
- From **Question 5**, it incorporates filtering undesired negative numbers and performing transformations based on conditions.

This question presents challenges across filtering, detection of duplication, grouping, and transformation, enhancing understanding of data manipulation and pattern recognition in Python.
