QUESTION

Write a function to find two elements from two sorted arrays such that their sum is closest to a given target value.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there was a syntax error with the solution due to misplaced code blocks. Let's fix this to ensure the solution is properly formatted and will execute without errors.

Here is the corrected solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(arr1, arr2, target):
    """
    Find two elements from two sorted arrays such that their sum is closest to the target value.
    :param arr1: List[int] - Sorted list of integers.
    :param arr2: List[int] - Sorted list of integers.
    :param target: int - Target sum value
    :return: Tuple[int, int] - Elements from arr1 and arr2 whose sum is closest to target.
    """
    i, j = 0, len(arr2) - 1
    closest_pair = (arr1[0], arr2[0])
    closest_diff = float('inf')

    while i < len(arr1) and j >= 0:
        current_sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j]
        current_diff = abs(current_sum - target)
        
        if current_diff < closest_diff:
            closest_diff = current_diff
            closest_pair = (arr1[i], arr2[j])
        
        if current_sum < target:
            i += 1
        else:
            j -= 1
            
    return closest_pair
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_general_case():
    arr1 = [1, 4, 5]
    arr2 = [2, 3, 6]
    target = 8
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    possible_solutions = [(5, 3), (4, 4)]
    assert result in possible_solutions
    
def test_single_element_arrays():
    arr1 = [2]
    arr2 = [3]
    target = 5
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    assert result == (2, 3)
    
def test_negative_numbers():
    arr1 = [-5, -3, 0, 3, 5]
    arr2 = [-10, -2, 1, 6, 8]
    target = 1
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    assert result == (3, -2) or result == (0, 1)
    
def test_zeros_in_arrays():
    arr1 = [0, 2, 4]
    arr2 = [-3, 0, 3]
    target = 1
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    assert result == (0, 3)

def test_identical_elements():
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
    arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
    target = 5
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    possible_solutions = [(2, 3), (3, 2)]
    assert result in possible_solutions
```
<|Test End|>

These blocks of code now follow proper syntax and should execute correctly without any syntax errors. The solution function utilizes a two-pointer method to identify the elements in the two arrays whose sum is closest to the specified target. The tests cover a range of test cases to verify the solution under different scenarios.
