QUESTION

Write a Python function to determine whether the given number can be expressed as the sum of a cube and a square of two non-negative integers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It looks like the solution and test outputs were not executed correctly due to a formatting error. I'll make sure to correctly structure the Python code blocks with only Python code inside them. Let's ensure the sections are formatted properly for Python execution.

Here's the corrected format:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n):
    """
    Determine if a given number n can be expressed as the sum of a cube of one non-negative integer
    and a square of another non-negative integer.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    # Determine the maximum value to consider for both cube and square
    max_cube_root = int(n ** (1/3)) + 1
    max_square_root = int(n ** 0.5) + 1

    # Iterate over possible values
    for i in range(max_cube_root):
        cube = i ** 3
        if cube > n:
            break
        for j in range(max_square_root):
            square = j ** 2
            if cube + square == n:
                return True
            if cube + square > n:
                break
    
    return False
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_sum_of_cube_and_square():
    assert solution(9) == True  # 8 (2^3) + 1 (1^2)
    assert solution(17) == True  # 8 (2^3) + 9 (3^2)
    assert solution(35) == True  # 27 (3^3) + 8 (2^2)
    assert solution(5) == True  # 1 (1^3) + 4 (2^2)
    assert solution(1) == True  # 0^3 + 1^2
    assert solution(29) == True  # 27 (3^3) + 2 (1^2)
    assert solution(0) == True  # 0^3 + 0^2

def test_solution_no_cube_and_square():
    assert solution(2) == False
    assert solution(3) == False
    assert solution(7) == False
    assert solution(11) == False

def test_solution_edge_cases():
    assert solution(-1) == False
    assert solution(1000000) == True  # Large number test (1000^3 + 0^2)
```
<|Test End|>

Please ensure that the solution function is being tested in an environment where it knows the correct path to the `solution` module. All of the code sections are now pure Python, properly encoded within their respective <|...|> markers. This should remove any prior syntax errors.
