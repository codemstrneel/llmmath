QUESTION

**Novel Combined Coding Question:**

Design a Python function named `process_and_rearrange_data` that takes a list of integer tuples, a list of strings, an ordered list of integers, and a target integer. The function should perform the following steps:

1. Convert each tuple within the list of tuples from a tuple of strings to a tuple of integers and sort the list of tuples based on their last element.
2. Remove tuples where any integer can be expressed as the sum of two squares.
3. Multiply adjacent elements within each tuple, appending a new value to the tuple representing the product of these elements.
4. From the resulting list of tuples, exclude any where the product computed matches the target integer.
5. Rearrange the filtered list of tuples based on the given ordered list of integers, using the first element from each tuple for ordering.
6. From the list of strings, remove any string that has a length greater than 5.
7. Return a tuple containing:
   - A list of processed and rearranged tuples.
   - A filtered list of strings.

For example:

```python
def process_and_rearrange_data(tuples_list, strings_list, ordered_list, target):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage:
tuples_list = [(('3', '5'), ('1', '4'), ('6', '8')), (('10', '7'), ('2', '9'), ('5', '13'))]
strings_list = ['hello', 'world', 'python', 'code', 'examples']
ordered_list = [5, 1, 3, 10]
target = 15
print(process_and_rearrange_data(tuples_list, strings_list, ordered_list, target))
```

**Explanation:**
- The function starts by converting tuples of strings into tuples of integers, then sorts the tuples based on the last element.
- It filters out tuples where any number in the tuple can be expressed as the sum of two squares.
- The function calculates the product of adjacent elements in each tuple, filters out tuples with a product equal to the target, and rearranges the list of tuples according to the ordered list provided, using the first element of each tuple.
- Finally, it filters the list of strings by removing any string longer than five characters and returns both the filtered and sorted list of tuples and the filtered string list as a tuple.

SOL & TESTS

Sure, let's tackle this problem by implementing the required function `process_and_rearrange_data` according to the specified instructions. We'll implement this function step by step and provide appropriate unit tests to ensure its correctness.

```python
import math

def is_sum_of_squares(n):
    """Check if a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares."""
    for i in range(int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        j = math.sqrt(n - i * i)
        if j == int(j):
            return True
    return False

def process_and_rearrange_data(tuples_list, strings_list, ordered_list, target):
    # Convert and sort tuples
    processed_tuples = []
    for sublist in tuples_list:
        converted = [tuple(map(int, item)) for item in sublist]
        sorted_tuples = sorted(converted, key=lambda x: x[-1])
        processed_tuples.extend(sorted_tuples)

    # Filter tuples where any number is expressable as sum of two squares
    filtered_tuples = [tup for tup in processed_tuples if not any(is_sum_of_squares(x) for x in tup)]

    # Multiply adjacent elements and append product
    for i, tup in enumerate(filtered_tuples):
        product = 1
        for j in range(len(tup) - 1):
            product *= tup[j] * tup[j+1]
        filtered_tuples[i] = tup + (product,)

    # Exclude tuples where the product equals target
    final_tuples = [tup for tup in filtered_tuples if tup[-1] != target]

    # Rearrange based on ordered_list using the first element
    final_tuples.sort(key=lambda x: ordered_list.index(x[0]) if x[0] in ordered_list else float('inf'))

    # Filter strings of length greater than 5
    final_strings = [s for s in strings_list if len(s) <= 5]

    return (final_tuples, final_strings)

In this solution:
- We first convert and sort sublists of tuples of strings into tuples of sorted integers by their last element.
- We filter out tuples with elements expressible as the sum of two squares.
- We calculate products of adjacent elements in each tuple, filter out products matching the target integer, and rearrange the filtered list according to the specified ordered list.
- Finally, we filter out strings longer than 5 characters and return the modified tuple lists and string lists.
