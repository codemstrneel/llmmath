```python
def filter_set_from_tuple(tuples):
    """
    Converts a list of tuples into a set, then removes any integer elements that are less than 10.

    Parameters:
    tuples (list of tuples): List containing tuples of integers.

    Returns:
    set: A set with integers from tuples that are 10 or greater.
    """
    # Flatten the list of tuples into a single list
    flattened_list = [item for sublist in tuples for item in sublist]
    
    # Convert the list to a set, automatically removing duplicates
