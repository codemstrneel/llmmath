QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of integers, a list of tuples, and a list of lists. The function should:

1. Filter the list of integers to include only those numbers that are prime and also divisible by any valid integer key (ignoring any None values) found within the tuples.
2. From the filtered list of integers, create a list of new lists, where each new list consists of:
   - The prime integer itself.
   - The index of the prime integer in the original list of integers.
   - A boolean indicating whether the prime integer shares the same index value (if present) in any of the lists within the list of lists.
3. Ensure processing is limited to the number of elements in the shortest list of lists.
4. Sort the list of new lists in descending order based on the prime integer values.
5. Return the two new lists with the highest prime integers. In case of a tie, return them ordered by the original index of the prime integer in ascending order.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The code execution output indicates that there was a syntax error, likely because the code was not properly included within the delimiters. Let's ensure we provide a correct version with the appropriate use of delimiters. Here's a refined version of the solution and the tests to account for the previous issues:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def solution(integers, tuples, list_of_lists):
    # Extract valid integer keys from tuples
    valid_keys = [t[0] for t in tuples if isinstance(t[0], int)]

    # Prime numbers processing and filtering
    filtered_primes = []
    for index, number in enumerate(integers):
        if is_prime(number) and any(number % key == 0 for key in valid_keys):
            matches_index_in_lists = any(
                index < len(inner_list) and inner_list[index] == number
                for inner_list in list_of_lists
            )
            filtered_primes.append([number, index, matches_index_in_lists])

    # Limiting processing to the length of the shortest list
    if list_of_lists:
        min_length = min(len(lst) for lst in list_of_lists)
        filtered_primes = [item for item in filtered_primes if item[1] < min_length]

    # Sort primes descending by number, then by ascending index
    filtered_primes.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))

    # Return top two entries
    return filtered_primes[:2]
```

These updates should address the initial test failures by ensuring criteria like the shortest list restriction and correct indices are fully respected.
