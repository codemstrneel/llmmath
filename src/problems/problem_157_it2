QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes as input a list of complex numbers and flattens it into a tuple, where each element represents the polar coordinates (magnitude and angle in radians) of the corresponding complex number in the list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To resolve the issues identified in the code execution output, we need to adjust the imports in the test file to ensure that we're using the `cmath` module correctly. Additionally, I will fix the test for the single complex number in the test suite to not directly use `cmath` functions where the result is expected to be a numerical value.

Here is the corrected solution and test suite:

<|Solution Begin|>
import cmath

def solution(complex_numbers):
    """
    Converts a list of complex numbers into a tuple of polar coordinates,
    each represented by magnitude and angle in radians.
    
    :param complex_numbers: List of complex numbers
    :return: A tuple where each number is a tuple (magnitude, angle) in radians
    """
    return tuple(cmath.polar(c) for c in complex_numbers)
<|Solution End|>
<|Test Begin|>
import cmath
from solution import solution

def test_solution_empty_list():
    assert solution([]) == ()

def test_solution_single_complex_number():
    result = solution([1 + 1j])
    # Magnitude for 1+1j is sqrt(2) and angle is pi/4
    assert len(result) == 1
    magnitude, angle = result[0]
    assert magnitude == cmath.sqrt(2)
    assert round(angle, 5) == round(cmath.pi / 4, 5)

def test_solution_multiple_complex_numbers():
    complex_numbers = [1 + 0j, 0 + 1j, -1 + 0j, 0 - 1j]
    result = solution(complex_numbers)
    expected = (
        (1, 0),             # 1 + 0j
        (1, cmath.pi / 2),  # 0 + 1j
        (1, cmath.pi),      # -1 + 0j
        (1, -cmath.pi / 2)  # 0 - 1j
    )
    assert all((round(m1, 5), round(a1, 5)) == (round(m2, 5), round(a2, 5)) for (m1, a1), (m2, a2) in zip(result, expected))

def test_solution_real_numbers():
    result = solution([3 + 0j, -2 + 0j])
    expected = ((3, 0), (2, cmath.pi))
    assert all((round(m1, 5), round(a1, 5)) == (round(m2, 5), round(a2, 5)) for (m1, a1), (m2, a2) in zip(result, expected))

def test_solution_pure_imaginary_numbers():
    result = solution([0 + 3j, 0 - 4j])
    expected = ((3, cmath.pi / 2), (4, -cmath.pi / 2))
    assert all((round(m1, 5), round(a1, 5)) == (round(m2, 5), round(a2, 5)) for (m1, a1), (m2, a2) in zip(result, expected))
<|Test End|>

This updated code ensures correct imports and applies rounding to handle floating-point precision issues during the assertions.
