QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes three parameters: a list of tuples, a string representing a date in yyyy-mm-dd format, and an integer k. First, the function should convert the date into dd-mm-yyyy format. Then, rotate each tuple in the list by k positions to the right. Next, determine whether the rotated tuple is a subset of another tuple that is constructed by splitting and structuring the newly formatted date. Finally, return a list of booleans where each boolean indicates whether the corresponding rotated tuple is a subset of the date-structured tuple.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to perform several steps as outlined in the question. Hereâ€™s how we'll approach it:

1. **Convert the Date Format**: Transform the input date from `yyyy-mm-dd` to `dd-mm-yyyy`.
2. **Rotate Tuples**: Rotate each tuple in the list by `k` positions to the right.
3. **Split and Structure the Date**: Once the date is in the correct format, split it into elements that can be compared with the tuples. For this, we can consider the date as (dd, mm, yyyy).
4. **Determine Subset**: Check whether each rotated tuple is a subset of the tuple formed from the new date format.
5. **Return Result**: Construct and return a list of booleans indicating whether each rotated tuple is a subset of the date-structured tuple.

Here's the solution implementation and the corresponding unit tests:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(tuples_list, date_str, k):
    # Convert date from yyyy-mm-dd to dd-mm-yyyy
    yyyy, mm, dd = date_str.split('-')
    date_tuple = (dd, mm, yyyy)
    
    def rotate_tuple(tup, k):
        # Rotate the tuple by k positions to the right
        k = k % len(tup)  # Ensure k is within bounds
        return tup[-k:] + tup[:-k]
    
    results = []
    for tup in tuples_list:
        rotated = rotate_tuple(tup, k)
        # Check if rotated tuple is a subset of the date tuple
        is_subset = all(item in date_tuple for item in rotated)
        results.append(is_subset)
    
    return results
<|Solution End|>
```

Next, we implement unit tests using pytest style to validate the solution:

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_basic_case():
    tuples_list = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), ('10', '02', '2023')]
    date_str = "2023-02-10"
    k = 1
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str, k) == [False, False, True]

def test_no_rotation():
    tuples_list = [(10, 2, 2023), ('10', '02', '2023')]
    date_str = "2023-02-10"
    k = 0
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str, k) == [True, True]

def test_fully_rotated():
    tuples_list = [(2, 2023, 10), (2023, 10, 2)]
    date_str = "2023-10-02"
    k = 3
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str, k) == [True, True]

def test_large_rotation():
    tuples_list = [(2023, 10, 2), ('2023', '10', '02')]
    date_str = "2023-10-02"
    k = 6
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str, k) == [True, True]

def test_no_match():
    tuples_list = [(11, 12, 13), (14, 15, 16)]
    date_str = "2023-02-10"
    k = 2
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str, k) == [False, False]

def test_partial_rotation():
    tuples_list = [(2023, 2, 10), ('10', 2023, '02')]
    date_str = "2023-10-02"
    k = 1
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str, k) == [False, False]

<|Test End|>
```

This code would function as a full testing routine for the provided problem, evaluating various edge cases and ensuring the solution handles them correctly.
