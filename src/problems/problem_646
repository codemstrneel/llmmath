QUESTION

**New Question:**

Design a Python function that operates on a circle and a formatted string representing a complex mathematical expression made up of specific components from prior questions. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **Circle Operations**:
   - Accept an integer representing the radius of a circle.
   - Calculate and return both the perimeter and area of the circle.
   - Convert these results into a string of capitalized letters, where each letter represents the ASCII value of a digit in each number (concatenated together), sorted lexicographically.

2. **Formatted String Processing**:
   - The string is composed of two parts separated by a special delimiter (e.g., `@`):
     - The first part is a sequence of characters representing an encoded mathematical operation using ASCII values that correspond to operations and numbers.
     - The second part consists of a numerical pattern to validate against the Fibonacci sequence.
   
3. **Tasks**:
   - Decode each character in the first part back to its corresponding mathematical operation or number by converting ASCII values.
   - Evaluate the decoded expression and merge the perimeter and area into this calculation (e.g., by adding, subtracting, or utilizing trigonometric functions).
   - Extract numerical sequences from the second part of the string and determine if they can be expressed as sums of distinct pairs of Fibonacci numbers.

4. **Return Results**:
   - Return a dictionary where:
     - Keys are the operations performed (like sum or difference of the circle's perimeter and area alongside the decoded mathematical operation).
     - Values are results represented as lists of Fibonacci numbers or combinations thereof that validate against sequences from the formatted string, in capitalized and sorted lexicographical order.

The function should handle invalid inputs gracefully, e.g., by returning error messages for unsupported characters in the string or impossible Fibonacci representations.

**Example:**

Given a radius, `r=5`, and a formatted string, `"83@23456"`, where ASCII 83 could represent a mathematical operation and numbers in `23456` are potential Fibonacci representations, process them to produce a result that includes:

- The perimeter and area calculation of the circle.
- Evaluated result of the complex encoded expression with the circle's measurements integrated.
- The Fibonacci validation outcomes, all expressed in the specified string format.

SOL & TESTS

To solve this task, we'll break it down into several steps:

1. **Circle Operations**: Calculate the circle's perimeter and area using basic formulas, convert the numbers to their corresponding ASCII values to create a string representation, and then sort these letters.

2. **Formatted String Processing**:
   - Decode the ASCII values from the first part of the input string to a mathematical operation.
   - Evaluate this operation using the perimeter and area as part of the calculation.

3. **Fibonacci Sequence Validation**:
   - Extract numbers from the second part of the string.
   - Check if these numbers can be represented as sums of distinct Fibonacci numbers.

4. **Return Results**: Formulate the results into a structured format that adheres to the requirements.

We'll define the solution with helper functions for clarity and test each part along with the whole integration.
