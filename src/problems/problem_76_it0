QUESTION

Write a function that processes a list of camel case strings where each string potentially represents a mathematical operation between two numbers (e.g., "AddThreeAndFour"). The function should first convert each string into a mathematical expression and evaluate it to produce a numeric result. If the operation cannot be clearly translated or evaluated, it should be ignored. After this, the function should convert each camel case string into snake case and append the evaluated result as an extension of each snake case string. For example, "AddThreeAndFour" would become "add_three_and_four_7". Return the list of these modified strings.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step-by-step.

Firstly, we need to identify the operations encoded within the camel case strings. The problem suggests that strings may represent operations with numbers, like "AddThreeAndFour". We will need a simple parser to convert these operations into computable expressions.

Let's outline the steps:
1. Convert the camel case string to a format that can be used to identify and compute the operations.
2. Evaluate these operations to compute numerical results.
3. Convert camel case strings to snake case and append results.

Here is the full implementation and testing code:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(operations):
    import re  # To use regular expressions for camel case conversion and number extraction.

    def camel_to_snake(name):
        """Convert a CamelCase string to snake_case."""
        s1 = re.sub('(.)([A-Z][a-z]+)', r'\1_\2', name)
        snake = re.sub('([a-z0-9])([A-Z])', r'\1_\2', s1).lower()
        return snake

    def evaluate_expression(expression):
        """Evaluate the expression represented by camel case string to extract result."""
        operation_map = {
            'add': '+',
            'subtract': '-',
            'multiply': '*',
            'divide': '/'
        }
        
        # Convert words to potential numbers
        word_to_number = {
            'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4,
            'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9
        }

        # Split the words based on capital letters to identify operations and numbers
        parts = re.findall(r'[A-Z][^A-Z]*', expression)

        # Simple parser checking parts against operations and numbers
        result = None
        current_operation = None

        for part in parts:
            part = part.lower()

            if part in word_to_number:
                number = word_to_number[part]
                
                if result is None:
                    result = number
                elif current_operation:
                    if current_operation == '/' and number == 0:
                        return None  # Cannot divide by zero
                    result = eval(f"{result}{current_operation}{number}")
                    current_operation = None

            elif part in operation_map:
                current_operation = operation_map[part]

        return result

    results = []

    for operation in operations:
        evaluated_result = evaluate_expression(operation)
        if evaluated_result is not None:
            snake_case = camel_to_snake(operation)
            results.append(f"{snake_case}_{int(evaluated_result)}")  # Ensures int for cleaner result

    return results
```

This solves the problem by addressing operations explicitly mentioned and mapping them to arithmetic expressions. I also included various test cases to ensure robustness of our `solution` function under different input scenarios.
