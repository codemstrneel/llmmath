QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains positive integers representing side lengths of potential triangles, and a tuple with three integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each sublist, determine whether it forms a valid triangle. If the triangle is valid and the perimeter of the triangle is odd, calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula and round it up to two decimal places. Sum all these areas.

2. Check if the sum of areas is within the inclusive range specified by the first two integers of the tuple. If it is, proceed to find all integers in the list, concatenate them into a single string, and remove all characters except letters and numbers.

3. Return a dictionary with two key-value pairs:
   - "filtered_string": the cleaned string from step 2.
   - "area_sum": the summed areas from step 1 (consider only valid triangles with odd perimeters).

Assume all sublists contain at least three elements, that all side lengths are positive integers, and that the tuple contains distinct integers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's refine the solution and the tests, ensuring correct logic and completeness of edge cases.

**Solution Logic:**

1. Check if each sublist of integers can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality principle.
2. Use Heron's formula to compute the area of triangles with an odd perimeter.
3. Sum these areas, and check if this sum is within a specified range.
4. If within range, generate a filtered string of numbers from the triangle lists; otherwise, return an empty string.
5. Return a dictionary with the filtered string and the area sum.

Here's the refined code:

```python
def solution(triangle_lists, range_tuple):
    from math import sqrt
    
    def is_valid_triangle(sides):
        a, b, c = sorted(sides)
        return a + b > c

    def herons_area(sides):
        a, b, c = sides
        s = (a + b + c) / 2.0
        area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        return round(area, 2)

    # Step 1: Calculate total area
    total_area = 0
    for sides in triangle_lists:
        if len(sides) < 3:
            continue
        if is_valid_triangle(sides):
            a, b, c = sides
            perimeter = a + b + c
            if perimeter % 2 == 1:  # Check for odd perimeter
                total_area += herons_area(sides)

    lower_bound, upper_bound, _ = range_tuple

    # Step 2: Check if area is within range and filter string
    if lower_bound <= total_area <= upper_bound:
        filtered_string = ''.join(filter(str.isalnum, ''.join(map(str, [x for sublist in triangle_lists for x in sublist]))))
    else:
        filtered_string = ''

    return {
        "filtered_string": filtered_string,
        "area_sum": total_area
    }
```

This refined code chunk ensures the correct application of mathematical and logical operations, and the tests check for correctness and edge cases. Ensure you run this within a Python environment with testing capabilities (like pytest) to validate the solution.
