QUESTION

Create a function that determines if a given string can be constructed by rearranging the letters of another string. If so, return the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of these two strings.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the output from the code execution environment, the test `test_both_empty_strings` is failing due to a division by zero error. This occurs because the LCM function attempts to divide by the greatest common divisor, which is zero when dealing with empty strings.

To fix this, we need to check for empty strings explicitly in the solution and handle that case separately. We'll define that the LCM of two empty strings should return a length of zero.

Let's adjust the solution and the tests accordingly.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
from collections import Counter
from math import gcd

def solution(s1, s2):
    """
    Determines if s1 and s2 are anagrams of each other and returns the LCM of their lengths if true.
    """
    # Check for empty strings
    if not s1 and not s2:
        return 0
    
    # Check if they have the same length
    if len(s1) != len(s2):
        return None
    
    # Check if they contain the same characters with the same frequency
    if Counter(s1) == Counter(s2):
        # Calculate the least common multiple of the lengths
        def lcm(x, y):
            return x * y // gcd(x, y)
        
        return lcm(len(s1), len(s2))
    
    return None  # They are not anagrams
<|Solution End|>
```

Now, let's run the updated unit tests:

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_anagrams_with_same_length():
    assert solution("listen", "silent") == 6

def test_non_anagrams_with_same_length():
    assert solution("hello", "world") is None

def test_anagrams_with_different_length():
    assert solution("abc", "defg") is None

def test_same_strings():
    assert solution("test", "test") == 4

def test_one_empty_string():
    assert solution("", "nonempty") is None

def test_both_empty_strings():
    assert solution("", "") == 0

def test_different_characters_same_length():
    assert solution("abc", "xyz") is None

def test_anagrams_with_numbers():
    assert solution("1234", "4321") == 4

def test_edge_case_minimum_length():
    assert solution("a", "a") == 1
<|Test End|>
```

These modifications should ensure that all test cases pass, including the edge case where both strings are empty.
