QUESTION

Write a Python function to calculate the sum of all odd natural numbers between two given integers \( l \) and \( r \), and then convert this sum into a single integer by appending it with each element in a given list of integers.

def solution(l, r, nums):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all odd natural numbers between l and r (inclusive),
    then convert this sum into a string and append it with each element in the list nums.

    Parameters:
    l (int): Lower bound of the range.
    r (int): Upper bound of the range.
    nums (list of int): List of integers.

    Returns:
    list of int: New list where each element is the integer result of appending 
    the sum of odd numbers to each element in nums.

    odd_sum_str = str(odd_sum)
    return [int(str(num) + odd_sum_str) for num in nums]
