QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that performs the following tasks:

1. Takes as input a triangle represented as a list of lists of numeric values and two tuples representing two points in a coordinate plane. The triangle list represents a triangular matrix where each row corresponds to a level in the triangle starting with a single element at the top.

2. Calculate the slope of the line formed by the given pair of integer coordinates and store the slope value.

3. Implement a modified dynamic programming approach to find the minimum total path sum from the top to the base of the triangle, similar to finding the minimum path in a triangle. However, as you traverse the triangle, if you encounter any value that is less than or equal to the calculated slope, consider it as an obstacle and only proceed through paths with values greater than the slope.

4. Return the minimum path sum that avoids the obstacles, along with a message indicating whether such a path exists.

This question combines the concepts of calculating slopes between two points and traversing a triangular matrix with obstacles, introducing a novel twist to dynamic programming pathfinding problems.
