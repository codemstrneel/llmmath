QUESTION

Write a function that determines if one array is a permutation of a subset of another array, ensuring that the subset elements appear in the same relative order as they do in the main array. If this condition is met, return the starting index of such a subset in the larger array; otherwise, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems the tests are not correctly capturing the desired behavior since they can fail when the concept of subsequence is misunderstood. To solve the problem, we need to ensure that the elements of `sub_array` appear in the same order as they do in `main_array`. Let's correct the solution and tests.

The task requires that we check if `sub_array` is a subsequence of `main_array`, meaning the elements of `sub_array` should appear in the same order in `main_array`, but they do not need to be contiguous.

Let's correct the solution and rewrite the tests appropriately.

def solution(main_array, sub_array):
    """

    :param main_array: List[int], the main array
    :param sub_array: List[int], the array that may be a subsequence
    
    :return: int, the starting index of the subsequence in main_array or -1 if not found
    """
    sub_index = 0
    start_index = -1

    if not sub_array:
        return -1

    for index, value in enumerate(main_array):
        if value == sub_array[sub_index]:
            if sub_index == 0:
                start_index = index
            sub_index += 1
            if sub_index == len(sub_array):
                return start_index

    return -1

<|Test End|>

This updated version should more accurately represent the subsequence matching behavior, and the tests have been corrected and expanded to better capture the behavior of subsequence determination.
