QUESTION

Write a function to convert a list of strings representing numbers into a tuple of floating-point numbers, ensuring that the strings can contain scientific notation and handle cases where the conversion might fail by raising a custom exception.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems the previous attempts encountered a syntax issue due to the code block markers not being implemented as intended. Let's fix this by directly using the output format you provided and ensure that the solution and tests are correctly formatted and free from errors.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(strings):
    """
    Converts a list of numeric strings into a tuple of floats.
    Raises ValueError if any string can't be converted.
    """
    try:
        return tuple(float(num_str) for num_str in strings)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError("One or more strings could not be converted to a float.") from e
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution
import pytest

def test_strings_to_floats_with_regular_numbers():
    assert solution(["1", "2", "3.5"]) == (1.0, 2.0, 3.5)

def test_strings_to_floats_with_scientific_notation():
    assert solution(["1e1", "2.5e-1", "3E4"]) == (10.0, 0.25, 30000.0)

def test_strings_to_floats_with_mixed_notations():
    assert solution(["1e2", "3.5", "6.02e23"]) == (100.0, 3.5, 6.02e23)

def test_strings_to_floats_with_invalid_strings():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="One or more strings could not be converted to a float."):
        solution(["1e1", "abc", "3.5"])

def test_strings_to_floats_with_empty_strings():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="One or more strings could not be converted to a float."):
        solution(["", "2.5", "0.01"])

def test_strings_to_floats_with_includes_spaces():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="One or more strings could not be converted to a float."):
        solution(["3.5", " 1e1 ", "2.5.8"])

def test_strings_to_floats_with_non_numeric_characters():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="One or more strings could not be converted to a float."):
        solution(["10", "-.5", "twenty"])
```
<|Test End|>

These sections are now properly formatted for execution. Ensure that each part (solution and tests) is within its respective block so that they can be compiled and tested correctly.
