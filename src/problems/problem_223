QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of tuples and a positive integer `n` as inputs. Each tuple consists of two elements â€” an integer and a list of strings. The task is to perform the following:

1. Sort the tuples into groups based on the remainder when the integer of each tuple is divided by `n`.
2. For each group, count the number of tuples that contain at least one string with a length greater than 3.
3. Within each group, calculate the maximum integer from all tuples in that group.
4. Return a dictionary where the keys are the remainders, and the values are tuples containing:
   - The count of tuples with at least one string longer than 3 characters.
   - The maximum integer in the group.

This problem involves grouping based on remainders, filtering strings by length, and determining maximum values from grouped elements.

    n (int): A positive integer for calculating remainders.

    Returns:
