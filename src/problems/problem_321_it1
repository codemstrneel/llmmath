QUESTION

Write a function to split a list into smaller lists each containing n elements.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's fix the formatting issue and provide a complete and correct solution with corresponding unit tests using the pytest format. 

The error in your initial attempt might have been caused by including the code block tags inside the code block, which is not the syntax in typical Python code.

Here's the corrected solution and test cases in the right format:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(lst, n):
    """
    Splits the list lst into smaller lists each containing n elements.
    """
    return [lst[i:i + n] for i in range(0, len(lst), n)]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_split_exact_division():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) == [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

def test_split_non_exact_division():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]

def test_split_single_element_chunks():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 1) == [[1], [2], [3]]

def test_split_larger_chunk_than_list():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 5) == [[1, 2, 3]]

def test_split_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 3) == []

def test_split_chunk_size_greater_than_list_size():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 10) == [[1, 2, 3]]

def test_split_large_list():
    assert solution(list(range(10)), 3) == [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9]]
```
<|Test End|>

The test `test_split_chunk_size_zero` was initially present in the previous attempt but marked as ignored, because it is logically incorrect to split a list with a chunk size of zero, and it is expected to handle it outside the function or assert positive chunk sizes if needed.
