QUESTION

Write a function that takes two arguments: a list of tuples and a string representing a date in yyyy-mm-dd format. The function should first convert the date to dd-mm-yyyy format, ensuring that it is a valid date. Then, for each tuple in the list, check if it is a subset of another tuple that has been created by splitting and structuring the newly formatted date string. The function should return a list of booleans, where each boolean indicates whether the corresponding tuple from the input list is a subset of the date-structured tuple.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears there was a syntax issue due to the code blocks possibly not being recognized appropriately in the execution environment. Let's make sure the provided solution and test case code is within proper Python code blocks, ensuring they are syntactically correct. 

The provided solution logic and tests appear to be well-structured, but I'll ensure there are no syntax issues by revisiting the solution and test code in an isolated and readable manner. I'll ensure the code executes in a standard Python environment without errors.

Hereâ€™s the corrected solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import datetime

def solution(tuples_list, date_str):
    # Convert date from 'yyyy-mm-dd' to 'dd-mm-yyyy'
    try:
        # Parse the date
        date_obj = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, '%Y-%m-%d')
        # Format the date in 'dd-mm-yyyy'
        formatted_date = date_obj.strftime('%d-%m-%Y')
    except ValueError:
        # If date is invalid, raise an error
        raise ValueError("Invalid date format or non-existent date")
    
    # Create a tuple from the formatted date
    date_tuple = tuple(formatted_date.split("-"))
    
    # Check if each tuple in the list is a subset of the date tuple
    result = [set(t).issubset(date_tuple) for t in tuples_list]
    
    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution
import pytest

def test_valid_date_and_tuples():
    tuples_list = [('12',), ('12', '11'), ('2023',)]
    date_str = '2023-11-12'
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str) == [True, True, True]

def test_invalid_date_format():
    tuples_list = [('31',)]
    date_str = '2023-02-29'  # Invalid date as 2023 is not a leap year
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid date format or non-existent date"):
        solution(tuples_list, date_str)

def test_tuples_not_subset():
    tuples_list = [('13',), ('2022',), ('11', '13')]
    date_str = '2023-11-12' 
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str) == [False, False, False]

def test_empty_tuples_list():
    tuples_list = []
    date_str = '2023-11-12'
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str) == []

def test_empty_tuple():
    tuples_list = [()]
    date_str = '2023-11-12'
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str) == [True]  # Empty tuple is subset of any tuple

def test_partial_subset():
    tuples_list = [('11',), ('2023', '12')]
    date_str = '2023-11-12'
    assert solution(tuples_list, date_str) == [True, False]
```
<|Test End|>

I ensured all elements are enclosed correctly within their respective Python code blocks. This format respects typical usage when upholding code structure and readability standards. If this solution and its tests are placed within a proper Python environment with access to all necessary imports, it should work without issues.
