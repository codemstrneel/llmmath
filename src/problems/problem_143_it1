QUESTION

Write a function that takes two arrays as input. First, check if every element in the first array appears at least once in the second array, regardless of order. If this condition is met, concatenate the two arrays into a nested structure where the first array appears as a subset inside the second array, but rotated left by a number of positions equal to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the lengths of the two arrays. Finally, return this nested structure.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the code execution output, the solution and tests need to be revised to handle the scenarios properly. Let's modify the solution and tests to resolve the issues.

### Solution Update:
1. The original solution might not handle array rotations correctly.
2. The condition to verify that each element in `arr1` is present in `arr2` is sound and should be retained.
3. A correct understanding of how to rotate `arr2` based on the gcd of its lengths is crucial.

### Test Update:
1. We need to ensure that the rotation and checks are tested correctly.
2. Covering common edge cases and ensuring the function behaves as expected in all valid scenarios.

Here is the revised solution and unit tests:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import math
from collections import Counter

def solution(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Concatenates two arrays into a nested structure where the first array appears as a subset
    inside the second array rotated to the left by the gcd of the lengths of the two arrays,
    provided every element in arr1 appears in arr2.

    Args:
    arr1 (list): The first array of elements.
    arr2 (list): The second array of elements.

    Returns:
    list: The nested structure combining both arrays if arr1 elements are in arr2, else None.
    """
    # Check if every element in arr1 appears in arr2 at least as many times
    count1 = Counter(arr1)
    count2 = Counter(arr2)
    
    for elem in count1:
        if count1[elem] > count2.get(elem, 0):
            return None
    
    # Calculate the rotation based on gcd of array sizes
    length1 = len(arr1)
    length2 = len(arr2)
    rotation_steps = math.gcd(length1, length2)

    # Rotate arr2 by the calculated steps
    if length2 > 0 and rotation_steps > 0:  # Ensure arr2 is not empty and rotation is positive
        rotated_arr2 = arr2[rotation_steps:] + arr2[:rotation_steps]
    else:
        rotated_arr2 = arr2[:]

    # Return the nested structure
    return [arr1, rotated_arr2]

    assert solution([1, 1], [1, 2, 1, 3]) == [[1, 1], [2, 1, 3, 1]]

def test_solution_with_no_rotation_needed():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]) == [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]]
<|Test End|>
```

### Explanation:
- The solution now explicitly checks that rotations are only attempted on non-empty arrays and ensures that rotations happen if they are meaningful (i.e., `rotation_steps > 0`).
- Additional tests include cases to check duplicate elements and ensure no unnecessary rotations if gcd does not imply so.
- These adjustments should align the function's behavior with the problem requirements.
