QUESTION

Write a function that finds the top k unique lists from a given list of lists, based on the minimum sum of elements within each list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The previous responses seem to have formatting issues that were causing the code to not execute properly. Let's correct the code format and ensure the function and tests are defined accurately within the specified sections.

## Corrected Solution and Tests

The task is to implement a solution where the function identifies the top `k` unique lists based on their minimum sum of elements. The solution should ensure that lists are considered based on their content, and `k` specifies the number of lists to return.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(list_of_lists, k):
    # Normalize lists as tuples to ensure uniqueness
    unique_lists = list(map(list, {tuple(lst) for lst in list_of_lists}))
    
    # Sort the unique lists by the sum of their elements
    sorted_unique_lists = sorted(unique_lists, key=lambda x: sum(x))
    
    # Return the top k lists with the smallest sums
    return sorted_unique_lists[:k]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_with_unique_lists():
    assert solution([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3]], 2) == [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

def test_solution_with_repeated_lists():
    result = solution([[1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], 1)
    assert result == [[1, 2]] or result == [[2, 1]]

def test_solution_more_k_than_lists():
    assert solution([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 6]], 5) == [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 6]]

def test_solution_with_negative_numbers():
    result = solution([[1, -2, 3], [-1, 2, -3], [0, 0, 0]], 3)
    expected = [[-1, 2, -3], [0, 0, 0], [1, -2, 3]]
    assert result == expected[:len(result)]

def test_solution_varied_lengths():
    result = solution([[3], [1, 2], [2, 1, 0]], 2)
    assert result == [[3], [1, 2]]

def test_solution_k_zero():
    assert solution([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0) == []

def test_solution_single_list():
    assert solution([[5, 5]], 1) == [[5, 5]]
```

### Explanation

- **Unique List Identification**: Convert each list to a tuple to easily identify unique lists using a set.
- **Sorting by Sum**: After obtaining unique lists, sort them based on the sum of elements to ensure we can identify the lists with the smallest sums.
- **Selecting Top k**: Slice the resulting sorted list to return only the top `k` elements.

### Consideration

- **Handling of Duplicates**: Lists like `[1, 2]` and `[2, 1]` are considered duplicates if we assume list content order does not matter. If the order matters and they are considered different, the set approach will naturally treat them as unique.
- **Robustness**: The test cases ensure coverage for key edge scenarios such as handling negative numbers, varying list lengths, zero `k` values, and cases where `k` exceeds available unique lists.
