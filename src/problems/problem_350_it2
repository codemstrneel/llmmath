QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes as input a list of dictionaries and a list of strings. Each dictionary contains numbers as values, and each string is a comma-separated series of numbers. The function should extract all numbers from the strings, move them to the respective dictionaries by calculating the sum of numbers in each dictionary, and store these sums in a new dictionary with the index of the original dictionary as the key. Use bitwise operations to ensure only even sums are included in the new dictionary. Return the new dictionary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The solution and tests appear to be mostly correct, but there is an issue with handling cases where the sum of the numbers results in an even value that should be captured in the output dictionary. We need to ensure that the calculated sum in each dictionary is checked correctly for evenness.

Let's revise the tests to ensure that we are capturing scenarios correctly.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(dictionaries, string_lists):
    """
    Extracts numbers from comma-separated strings, calculates sums for each dictionary,
    filters even sums using bitwise operations, and stores them in a new dictionary.
    """
    def extract_numbers(string_lst):
        numbers = []
        for string in string_lst:
            if string.strip():
                numbers.extend(int(num) for num in string.split(',') if num.strip().lstrip('-').isdigit())
        return numbers

    sums = {}
    for idx, d in enumerate(dictionaries):
        # Calculate current sum of values in dictionary
        current_sum = sum(d.values())

        # Extract numbers from corresponding string in list
        additional_numbers = extract_numbers([string_lists[idx]])

        # Calculate new sum
        total_sum = current_sum + sum(additional_numbers)

        # Check if sum is even using bitwise operation
        if total_sum & 1 == 0:
            sums[idx] = total_sum

    return sums

from solution import solution

def test_example_case():
    dicts = [{'a': 2, 'b': 4}, {'x': 3}, {'y': 1, 'z': 5}]
    strings = ["3,2", "1,6", "3"]
    expected_output = {0: 11, 1: 10}
    assert solution(dicts, strings) == expected_output

def test_empty_lists():
    dicts = [{}]
    strings = [""]
    expected_output = {0: 0}
    assert solution(dicts, strings) == expected_output

def test_empty_dict_and_string():
    dicts = []
    strings = []
    expected_output = {}
    assert solution(dicts, strings) == expected_output

def test_no_even_sum():
    dicts = [{'a': 1}]
    strings = ["1"]
    expected_output = {}
    assert solution(dicts, strings) == expected_output

def test_large_numbers():
    dicts = [{'a': 2**31, 'b': 2**31}]
    strings = ["0"]
    expected_output = {0: 2**32}
    assert solution(dicts, strings) == expected_output

def test_negative_numbers():
    # Adjusting the expected output, as total will be -11 but it is not even
    dicts = [{'a': -2, 'b': -4}]
    strings = ["-3,-2"]
    expected_output = {}
    assert solution(dicts, strings) == expected_output

def test_mixed_odd_even():
    dicts = [{'a': 1, 'b': 3}, {'c': 2}]
    strings = ["2,4", "3"]
    expected_output = {0: 10}
    assert solution(dicts, strings) == expected_output

def test_all_zero_sums():
    dicts = [{'a': 0}, {'b': 0}]
    strings = ["0", "0"]
    expected_output = {0: 0, 1: 0}
    assert solution(dicts, strings) == expected_output

def test_mixed_integers():
    dicts = [{'a': -1, 'b': 1}, {'c': 2, 'd': -2}]
    strings = ["0", "3,4"]
    expected_output = {1: 7}
    assert solution(dicts, strings) == expected_output
<|Test End|>

This revised set of tests should now correctly ensure the solution behaves as expected in the scenarios described. The key changes include ensuring only even sums are captured, especially considering edge cases like zeros and mixtures of positive and negative numbers.
