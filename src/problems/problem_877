QUESTION

New Question:

Write a Python function that takes a dictionary containing city names as keys and tuples of integers as values. The function should perform the following operations:

1. For each tuple, convert it into a list of strings using the `map` function and calculate the sum of the integers.
2. If the sum of the integers falls within the range of 50 to 100 (inclusive), append a new entry to a result dictionary: the key should be the city name abbreviated using the rules ('road' to 'rd.' and 'street' to 'st.') and the value should be the sum of the integers.
3. Once processed, generate a list of tuples from the result dictionary, sorted in increasing order by the sums (values in the dictionary).
4. Return the sorted list of tuples.

The function should efficiently combine operations on dictionaries, tuples, lists, and strings while incorporating conditional checks and sorting.
