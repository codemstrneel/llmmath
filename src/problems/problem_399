QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of tuples and performs the following operations: First, convert each tuple into a set. Then, for each element in these sets, raise the element to the power of its index within the tuple (assuming all elements are integers). Afterward, multiply each resultant element by the sum of the original tuple. Finally, return a single set containing all the unique results from these operations. Use lambda functions and the map function to achieve this, and ensure the function works efficiently for large lists by optimizing for time complexity.
