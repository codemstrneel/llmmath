QUESTION

Write a function that takes a string consisting of both words representing numbers in camel case format and fractional numbers in a space-separated format. The function should perform the following tasks:
1. Convert the camel case words representing numbers into their integer equivalents, convert the string to a snake case representation, and collect these integers into a list. The function should ensure that this part of the string has at least five valid numerical words.
2. In the same string, ensure that fractional numbers are valid (e.g., "1/2", "3/4"), and convert them to floats. Collect these floats into a separate list.
3. Return a list that combines both the list of integers and the list of floats, keeping them in the order they were originally found in the string. Assume the string may have extra spaces and account for this in your processing.

SOLUTION/TESTS

I understand that there was an error in the code execution due to a syntax error. This could be a result of improper Python code formatting, especially in the solution section. Let's correct this by reviewing and ensuring that the solution and test sections are correctly formatted and implemented.

This should now properly define the solution and corresponding tests for the problem statement. I've ensured proper syntax and functionality based on the provided requirements.
