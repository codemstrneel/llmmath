QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of integers, a list of strings, and a list of tuples. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Filter the list of integers to include only numbers that are polite and divisible by an integer present in at least one tuple from the list of tuples (ignore any None values in the tuples).
2. Construct a list of tuples from the filtered integers, where each tuple consists of:
   - The index of the integer in the original list of integers.
   - The integer itself.
   - A concatenation of the corresponding string from the list of strings with an indication of whether the integer at that index has even or odd parity.
3. Ensure that if the list of strings is shorter than the list of integers, the processing is limited to the length of the list of strings.
4. Return the list of constructed tuples, sorted in descending order based on the integer values within the tuples.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems the initial solution and test setup were incorrect regarding the logic used for verifying politeness and divisibility. Let's revisit the explanation and revise both the solution and the tests to address the errors.

### Explanation
1. **Polite Numbers**: The definition used for politeness was correct. Polite numbers can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. Consequently, every integer other than a power of two is polite.

2. **Filtering Criteria**: 
   - Numbers that are polite.
   - Numbers that are divisible by at least one non-None element in the tuples list.

3. **Tuple Construction**: For every valid integer, create a tuple consisting of:
   - The index of the integer.
   - The integer itself.
   - The corresponding string with its parity.

4. **Result Truncation and Sorting**: Process only until the shortest length between the integers and strings, and finally, sort by the integer value descending.

Let's correct the solution and test cases:

```python
def is_polite_number(n):
    """
    Function to check if a number is a polite number.
    Polite numbers can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
    All numbers except for powers of two are considered polite numbers.
    """
    return n > 1 and (n & (n-1)) != 0

def solution(integers, strings, tuples_list):
    def is_divisible_by_any_tuple(n, tuples):
        for t in tuples:
            for value in t:
                if value is not None and n % value == 0:
                    return True
        return False

    polite_and_divisible = [
        (index, n)
        for index, n in enumerate(integers)
        if is_polite_number(n) and is_divisible_by_any_tuple(n, tuples_list)
    ]
    
    result = []
    for index, num in polite_and_divisible:
        if index < len(strings):
            parity = "even" if num % 2 == 0 else "odd"
            result.append((index, num, f"{strings[index]} {parity}"))

    return sorted(result, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```
