QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list as input and groups every two adjacent elements into sublists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the syntax errors and ensure that the solution and test are correctly formatted. Also, we will adjust the test for the large list to correctly match the expected output. I'll provide the correct solution and tests below:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(lst):
    """
    Takes a list and groups every two adjacent elements into sublists.
    If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element will be in a sublist by itself.

    Parameters:
    lst (list): The list to group.

    Returns:
    list: A list of sublists, where each sublist contains up to two elements from the input list.
    """
    return [lst[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(lst), 2)]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_even_number_of_elements():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

def test_odd_number_of_elements():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]

def test_single_element():
    assert solution([1]) == [[1]]

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([]) == []

def test_string_elements():
    assert solution(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) == [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]

def test_mixed_elements():
    assert solution([1, 'b', 3, 'd', True]) == [[1, 'b'], [3, 'd'], [True]]

def test_large_list():
    input_list = list(range(1, 101))  # List from 1 to 100
    expected = [[i, i + 1] for i in range(1, 100, 2)]
    assert solution(input_list) == expected
```
<|Test End|>

In this corrected version, the solution remains the same because it's already correct. The large list test (`test_large_list`) has been adjusted to ensure that it pairs elements correctly from 1 to 100 and will correctly verify the function's ability to handle larger inputs.
