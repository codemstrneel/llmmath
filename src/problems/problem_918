QUESTION

**New Question 6:**

Write a function to find the longest sequence of pairs that can be formed from a given list of pairs. Then, derive and return a list of unique non-overlapping subsequences from a given string such that each subsequence is formed by skipping over some characters from the original string without rearranging. Each subsequence should begin with a starting character and end with an ending character that must appear in the same order as they were found in the pairs of the longest sequence.

**Example:**

Given pairs = \[(5, 6), (3, 4), (1, 2)], the longest sequence of pairs is \[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)].

Given string = "abcdbc", possible unique subsequences can be \["abc", "dbc"\].

The function should return \["abc", "dbc"\].

SOL & TESTS

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to perform two tasks:

1. **Find the Longest Sequence of Pairs:**
   - A sequence of pairs is formed when each pair (x, y) can be followed by another pair (a, b) where `y < a`.
   - The task involves sorting the pairs primarily by the first element and then applying a logic similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).
   
2. **Extract Unique Non-Overlapping Subsequences From the Given String:**
   - Each subsequence should start with a character that maps to the beginning of a pair from the longest sequence and ends with a character that corresponds to the ending of that pair, while maintaining the order.
   - This can be done by scanning the string and extracting subsequences based on the occurrences of these starting and ending characters in order.
   
Here is the solution:

```python
def longest_sequence_of_pairs(pairs):
    # Sort pairs by the first element
    pairs = sorted(pairs)
    n = len(pairs)
    dp = [1] * n
    parent = [-1] * n
    
    # Dynamic programming to find the longest sequence
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if pairs[j][1] < pairs[i][0]:
                if dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]:
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
                    parent[i] = j
                    
    max_length = max(dp)
    index = dp.index(max_length)
    
    # Reconstruct the longest sequence using parent array
    longest_sequence = []
    while index != -1:
        longest_sequence.append(pairs[index])
        index = parent[index]
    
    return list(reversed(longest_sequence))

def unique_subsequences(string, longest_pairs):
    subsequences = []
    idx = 0
    n = len(string)
    
    for start, end in longest_pairs:
        while idx < n and string[idx] != start:
            idx += 1
        if idx < n:
            subsequence = []
            while idx < n and string[idx] != end:
                subsequence.append(string[idx])
                idx += 1
            if idx < n:  # We found the end character
                subsequence.append(string[idx])
                idx += 1
                subsequences.append(''.join(subsequence))
    
    return subsequences

def solve_problem(pairs, string):
    longest_pairs = longest_sequence_of_pairs(pairs)
    return unique_subsequences(string, longest_pairs)
