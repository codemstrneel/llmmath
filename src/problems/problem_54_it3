QUESTION

Write a function that takes a camel case string representation of a series of fractional numbers, converts it to a snake case string, and then returns the fractions as a tuple of floats.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears that the previous solution and test approach had issues handling camel case fractional strings correctly, particularly with the `Point` conversion into periods. Let's refine the function to handle these cases more robustly.

The approach needs to accurately split the camel case string, convert words to numbers, and resolve fractional representations. To ensure we're handling the camel case structure properly, we'll need to parse the strings and correctly interpret both integer and fractional parts.

Let's implement an accurate solution and adjust the tests accordingly.

        'Zero': '0',

        'Two': '2',
        'Three': '3',

        for part in parts:
            if part in number_words:

                # If we cannot interpret the part, skip conversion (optional)
                return None
        return number_string

    # Split camel case string into potential number phrases
    phrases = re.split('([A-Z][a-z]*)', camelCaseFractions)
    phrases = list(filter(None, phrases))  # Filter out empty strings from split

    numbers = []
    current_phrase = ''
    for phrase in phrases:
        current_phrase += phrase
        number_string = convert_phrase_to_number(current_phrase)
        if number_string is not None:
            try:
                # Attempt conversion to float
                numbers.append(float(number_string))
                current_phrase = ''  # Reset for next number
            except ValueError:
                pass  # Continue accumulating parts

from solution import solution

<|Test End|>

This solution now should properly handle the camel case input, recognizing the "Point" as a decimal point insertion, and convert word numbers efficiently into numeric form before accumulating fully-formed float numbers into a tuple. The tests are designed to cover various scenarios that include fractions, integers, and mixed sequences.
