QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes three inputs: a list of indices, a larger array, and a dictionary. The function should perform the following steps:

1. Extract the elements from the larger array at the specified indices and store them in a new list.
2. Check if all unique values from the dictionary's values are present in the newly created list from step 1. If not, return "Elements not found."
3. If the condition is met, calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the number of dictionary keys and the total number of elements extracted in step 1.
4. Return a new dictionary, where each original key maps to a tuple containing:
   - A rotated version of its associated value list, rotated left by the gcd calculated in step 3.
   - The list of extracted elements from step 1.

This question combines the concepts of list and dictionary manipulation, checking element presence, and performing operations with the gcd.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issue arises because the rotation logic and test expectations are not correctly aligned with the problem's requirements. Let's go through the solution and fix the logic and test expectations as needed.

### Solution Update
The solution already calculates the `gcd` between the number of dictionary keys and the number of extracted elements. The rotation occurs with this value, but each list should rotate left by this computed gcd value.

### Test Update
For the test `test_multiple_rotations`, we need to correctly decide the rotational expectation based on the computed gcd value, and the overall length of lists being rotated. 

Below is the corrected implementation:

<|Solution Begin|>
from math import gcd
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Tuple
from collections import deque

def solution(indices: List[int], array: List[int], mapping: Dict[str, List[int]]) -> Union[str, Dict[str, Tuple[List[int], List[int]]]]:
    extracted_elements = [array[i] for i in indices if i < len(array)]

    unique_values_in_mapping = set(val for values in mapping.values() for val in values)
    
    if not unique_values_in_mapping.issubset(set(extracted_elements)):
        return "Elements not found."
    
    num_keys = len(mapping)
    num_extracted = len(extracted_elements)
    common_divisor = gcd(num_keys, num_extracted)

    new_dict = {}
    for key, values in mapping.items():
        rotated_values = values[common_divisor:] + values[:common_divisor]
        new_dict[key] = (rotated_values, extracted_elements)
    
    return new_dict

    indices = [0, 1, 3]

    mapping = {
        "a": [50],
        "b": [10, 20]
    }
    assert solution(indices, array, mapping) == "Elements not found."

        "z": ([3, 4, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4])

    assert solution(indices, array, mapping) == expected_output

    }
    expected_output = {

    }
    assert solution(indices, array, mapping) == expected_output

    indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    array = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    mapping = {
        "alpha": [7, 5, 6, 8, 9],
        "beta": [6, 8, 9, 7, 5],
        "gamma": [8, 9, 7, 5, 6]
    }
    expected_output = {
        # gcd(3 (number of keys), 5 (number of extracted elements)) = 1
        # Hence, rotate the lists by 1
        "alpha": ([5, 6, 8, 9, 7], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]),
        "beta": ([8, 9, 7, 5, 6], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]),
        "gamma": ([9, 7, 5, 6, 8], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    }
    assert solution(indices, array, mapping) == expected_output
<|Test End|>

This polished version of the test case and solution correctly applies the computed gcd to perform rotations on the lists, ensuring the elements are rotated left by the correct number of steps while restoring the original list when needed. This fix ensures the solution meets the original problem statement requirements.
