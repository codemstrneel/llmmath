QUESTION

### New Question:

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers `numbers` and a string `equation` as inputs. The `equation` string represents the coefficients of a quadratic equation in the form "ax^2 + bx + c = 0", where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers embedded within the string, potentially mixed with other non-numeric characters. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Extract the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the input string `equation`.
2. Calculate the discriminant \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\) and determine if it is a perfect square.
3. For each contiguous subarray in `numbers`, determine if the subarray's starting and ending elements are equal and if the sum of this subarray is equal to the discriminant \(\Delta\).
4. If the above condition is satisfied for any subarray, count how many such subarrays exist.
5. Check whether the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form an arithmetic progression.
6. If the coefficients form an arithmetic progression, return the count of subarrays from step 4; otherwise, return -1.

The function should return the integer result based on the above logic.

### Example:

Given the list of integers `numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]` and the equation string `equation = "3x^2 + 12x + 9 = 0"`:

1. Extracted coefficients: \(a = 3\), \(b = 12\), \(c = 9\).
2. Discriminant \(\Delta = 12^2 - 4 \times 3 \times 9 = 144 - 108 = 36\), which is a perfect square.
3. Subarrays with equal starting and ending elements:
   - [1, 2, 2, 3, 1] (sum = 9)
   - [2, 2] (sum = 4)
   - [3, 1] (not equal)
   - ...
   - (demonstrate only those matching a specified sum, in this case, 36, if any)

4. Arithmetic progression check for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\): \(3, 12, 9\) do not form an arithmetic sequence.
5. Return: -1 (since the coefficients do not form an arithmetic progression).

### Constraints:

1. The string `equation` is guaranteed to have integers embedded within it, representing coefficients, potentially mixed with other non-numeric characters.
2. The list `numbers` will have at least one element.
3. The discriminant will be small enough to check if it is a perfect square without overflow.
