QUESTION

Write a Python function to calculate the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers up to a given positive integer n. Additionally, the function should also return the count of even Fibonacci numbers found within this range.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the syntax issue by ensuring that our code is properly formatted and re-evaluate the test cases to ensure they align with the expected behavior of the solution. Here is the corrected version:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum and count of all even Fibonacci numbers up to a given positive integer n.
    
    Args:
    - n (int): The upper bound for Fibonacci numbers to be considered.
    
    Returns:
    - tuple: A tuple containing the sum of even Fibonacci numbers and their count.
    """
    a, b = 0, 1
    even_sum = 0
    even_count = 0
    while b <= n:
        if b % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += b
            even_count += 1
        a, b = b, a + b
    return even_sum, even_count
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_basic():
    assert solution(1) == (0, 0)
    assert solution(2) == (2, 1)  # Even Fibonacci: 2
    assert solution(8) == (10, 3)  # Even Fibonacci: 2, 8

def test_solution_no_even_fibonacci():
    assert solution(0) == (0, 0)
    assert solution(1) == (0, 0)

def test_solution_large_value():
    assert solution(100) == (44, 3)  # Even Fibonacci: 2, 8, 34

def test_solution_single_even_fibonacci():
    assert solution(3) == (2, 1)  # Even Fibonacci: 2
    assert solution(5) == (2, 1)  # Even Fibonacci: 2
    assert solution(13) == (10, 2)  # Even Fibonacci: 2, 8
    assert solution(21) == (10, 2)  # Even Fibonacci: 2, 8

def test_solution_just_above_even_fibonacci():
    assert solution(34) == (44, 3)  # Even Fibonacci: 2, 8, 34
    assert solution(35) == (44, 3)  # Even Fibonacci: 2, 8, 34
    assert solution(33) == (10, 2)  # Even Fibonacci: 2, 8; 34 should not be included
```
<|Test End|>

With the correct format and comments added to describe expected even Fibonacci numbers in each test case, this should accurately reflect the expected behavior of the solution function. Adjustments were made to ensure the expected count of even Fibonacci numbers is correct.
