QUESTION

New Question:
Write a Python function that takes a string as input and performs two operations: First, removes all text enclosed in parentheses. Then, from the resulting string, identify and return all unique words that are enclosed in quotation marks, ensuring these words are ordered alphabetically. Utilize the `collections` module and regular expressions for efficient implementation.

<|Solution Begin|>```python
import re
from collections import OrderedDict

def extract_and_sort_quoted_words(input_string):
    """
    Removes text inside parentheses and extracts, sorts, and returns unique words within quotation marks.
    The result is a list of words ordered alphabetically.
    
    :param input_string: A string possibly containing text inside parentheses and words within quotation marks.
    :return: A list of unique quoted words in alphabetical order.
    """
    # Remove text within parentheses
    no_parentheses = re.sub(r'\(.*?\)', '', input_string)
    
    # Find all quoted words
    quoted_words = re.findall(r'"(.*?)"', no_parentheses)
    
    # Use OrderedDict to ensure uniqueness and preserve order for sorting
    unique_quoted_words = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(quoted_words))
    
    # Sort the list of unique quoted words
    unique_quoted_words.sort()
    
    return unique_quoted_words
