QUESTION

Write a function that takes a single string and a list of numbers as input. The function should return a dictionary where the keys are the non-repeated characters from the string that appear at the end of the string only if they are alphanumeric, and the values are the sum of prime numbers from 1 up to each number in the list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there was an issue with the execution environment possibly due to the incorrect formatting of code blocks or some other syntax error. Let's revise the solution and the tests, ensuring everything is correctly formatted and logically sound.

### Corrected Solution Explanation
1. **Objective**: Extract unique alphanumeric characters that only appear once and are at the end of the string. Then, for each character, calculate the sum of prime numbers for each number in the provided list.

2. **Process**:
   - Iterate over the string in reverse to find the last occurrence of each character.
   - Use a helper to determine prime numbers up to a given number.
   - Create a dictionary with keys as the characters and values as the sum of prime numbers.

3. **Correction**:
   - **Dictionary Values**: Originally, the solution produced a dictionary with the same key and values for each number list. We need to review and ensure it properly aligns with requirements or input expectations.

This adjusted solution and test suite should handle the problem requirements more effectively and should avoid previously seen syntax issues.
