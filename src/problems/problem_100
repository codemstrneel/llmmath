QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that combines geometric calculations, arithmetic and pattern recognition, and numerical property analysis. The function should take four inputs: a float radius, a list of integers representing angles in a circle, a mixed list containing floats and lists of integers, and an integer \( n \).

The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **Geometric and Arithmetic Progression Analysis:**
   - For each angle in the list, calculate the arc length on a circle with the given radius. Use the formula: \(\text{Arc Length} = \frac{\text{angle} \times \pi \times \text{radius}}{180}\).
   - Identify any arithmetic progressions within these calculated arc lengths (rounded to two decimal places) and return all such progressions.

2. **Mixed List Numerical Transformation:**
   - For each float in the mixed list, calculate its square root and compile a list of unique integer parts of these square roots. If these integer parts can form an arithmetic progression, include them in the output.
   - For each list of integers in the mixed list, double every even integer and sum all integers in the list. If these sums are abundant numbers (numbers for which the sum of their proper divisors exceeds the number itself), return these sums.

3. **Lucid Number Sequences:**
   - Generate all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to \( n \). A lucid number is a number such that the sum of its digits is a prime number. Analyze this sequence to identify any numeric patterns or subsequences and return those patterns.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- A list of arithmetic progressions identified from both the arc lengths and the integer parts of the square roots.
- A list of sums from the mixed list's integer lists that are abundant numbers.
- A list of identified numeric patterns or subsequences from the sequence of lucid numbers.

This question integrates geometric calculations, detection of arithmetic patterns, and the analysis of numeric properties to deliver a complex and multifaceted computational challenge.
