QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two lists of tuples as input and returns the maximum cumulative sum of the products of similar indices from these lists. Specifically, for each corresponding pair of tuples (i.e., at the same index in both lists), calculate the product of their elements, and sum these products across all tuple pairs. Return the maximum cumulative sum that can be obtained by considering only one tuple from each list at every index.

SOL & TESTS

Sure, let's start by defining a function that takes two lists of tuples as input, calculates the product of elements within corresponding tuples, and sums these products to find the maximum cumulative sum possible. Then, we'll write the unit tests to ensure our solution is correct.

Here is a structured implementation of the solution and corresponding unit tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def max_cumulative_product_sum(list1, list2):
    """
    Calculate the maximum cumulative sum of the products of pairs of tuples,
    one from each list at every index.
    
    Each tuple contains two elements, and the product is calculated as:
    product = (tuple1[0] * tuple2[0]) + (tuple1[1] * tuple2[1]).
    
    Args:
    - list1: List of tuples with numerical elements.
    - list2: List of tuples with numerical elements.
    
    Returns:
    - The maximum cumulative sum of products.
    """
    max_sum = 0
    for (a1, b1), (a2, b2) in zip(list1, list2):
        # Calculate the product for both tuples at the current index
        product1 = a1 * a2
        product2 = b1 * b2
        max_sum += product1 + product2
        
    return max_sum
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import max_cumulative_product_sum

def test_positive_elements():
    list1 = [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
    list2 = [(5, 6), (7, 8)]
    assert max_cumulative_product_sum(list1, list2) == (1*5 + 2*6) + (3*7 + 4*8)

def test_mixed_elements():
    list1 = [(1, -2), (-3, 4)]
    list2 = [(5, -6), (-7, 8)]
    assert max_cumulative_product_sum(list1, list2) == (1*5 + (-2)*(-6)) + ((-3)*(-7) + 4*8)

def test_zeros_in_lists():
    list1 = [(0, 2), (3, 0)]
    list2 = [(0, 6), (0, 8)]
    assert max_cumulative_product_sum(list1, list2) == (0*0 + 2*6) + (3*0 + 0*8)

def test_empty_lists():
    list1 = []
    list2 = []
    assert max_cumulative_product_sum(list1, list2) == 0

def test_single_element_lists():
    list1 = [(2, 3)]
    list2 = [(4, 5)]
    assert max_cumulative_product_sum(list1, list2) == (2*4 + 3*5)
```
<|Test End|>

This solution and test suite ensures that the function calculates and returns the maximum cumulative sum of products correctly. The tests cover various cases, including positive and negative values, zeros, empty lists, and single-element lists.
