QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list, a tuple, and a string as input. The function should first check if the string ends with any alphanumeric character. If it does, add the tuple to the list. Then, the function should return a collection containing the most common element from this updated list and its count.

    This function takes a list, a tuple, and a string as input. It checks if
