QUESTION

Write a function that, given a list of tuples and an integer n, returns the minimum sum of the second elements from n unique tuples of the given list of tuples.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum sum of the second elements from a certain number of unique tuples from the given list of tuples. The uniqueness criterion is based on the first element of the tuples. Here is a step-by-step approach to solve this:

1. We'll first sort the list of tuples based on the second element (which we'll sum) and keep track of the tuples' uniqueness using the first element.
2. Then, we'll iterate over the sorted list and select the tuples to form the minimum sum, ensuring each selected tuple is from a unique first element.
3. We'll continue to select tuples until we've picked `n` unique first elements or determined that it's not possible due to an insufficient number of such elements.

Let's implement the solution and its corresponding unit tests.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(tuples_list, n):
    """
    Given a list of tuples and an integer n, returns the minimum sum of the 
    second elements from n unique tuples from the list.
    """
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element
    tuples_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # A set to keep track of unique first elements
    unique_first_elements = set()
    
    # Accumulate the sum of selected tuple's second elements
    sum_second_elements = 0
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for t in tuples_list:
        if t[0] not in unique_first_elements:
            unique_first_elements.add(t[0])
            sum_second_elements += t[1]
            if len(unique_first_elements) == n:
                break
    
    # If we could collect n unique elements
    if len(unique_first_elements) == n:
        return sum_second_elements
    else:
        # if not possible to find n unique ones, return None or appropriate response
        return None

<|Test Begin|>
def test_minimum_sum_three_unique():
    tuples_list = [(1, 5), (2, 3), (3, 6), (4, 2)]
    assert solution(tuples_list, 3) == 10

def test_minimum_sum_insufficient_unique_elements():
    tuples_list = [(1, 5), (1, 3), (2, 6), (2, 2)]
    assert solution(tuples_list, 3) is None

def test_minimum_sum_exact_unique_elements():
    tuples_list = [(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2)]
    assert solution(tuples_list, 3) == 13

def test_minimum_sum_with_extra_tuples():
    tuples_list = [(1, 10), (2, 5), (3, 1), (4, 7), (5, 12)]
    assert solution(tuples_list, 2) == 6

def test_minimum_sum_with_duplicates():
    tuples_list = [(1, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)]
    assert solution(tuples_list, 3) == 15

def test_minimum_sum_single_tuple():
    tuples_list = [(1, 100)]
    assert solution(tuples_list, 1) == 100
<|Test End|>
```

The unit tests are designed to cover varying scenarios, including:
- Enough unique tuples to meet the requirement.
- Insufficient unique tuples.
- Edge cases with exact unique tuples matching `n`.
- Handling cases where multiple tuples have the same first element.
