QUESTION

Write a Python function that processes a list of integer pairs and an integer \( k \) to produce a new list through the following stages:

1. **Exclusion Stage:** Eliminate any pair where both integers are odd.
2. **Modification Stage:** For each remaining pair, convert both integers to their opposite (positive to negative and vice versa) only if the sum of their original values is even and not a multiple of \( k \).
3. **Division and Sorting Stage:** Divide the pairs into subgroups of size \( k \). Within each subgroup, reorder the pairs by the absolute difference between the integers in descending order.
4. **Final Combine Stage:** For each subgroup, return a tuple containing the total count of pairs and the list of sorted pairs.

Examples:
- Given the integer pairs `[(4, 3), (1, 7), (6, 3), (8, -2)]` with \( k \) as 2, the function processes through exclusion, modification, division, and sorting to provide the final output.
- For pairs `[(5, 2), (4, 4), (-3, 3), (9, -4)]` with \( k \) as 3, follow through the steps to generate the result.

This task encourages you to engage with complex filtering, conditional modifications, subgroup sorting, and aggregation transformations.
