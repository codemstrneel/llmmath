QUESTION

**Novel Integrated Coding Challenge:**

Create a function that takes a list of phrases, a list of numbers, and a special pattern as input. The task requires the integration of multiple programming concepts:

1. **Alphanumeric Check and Consonant Alteration:**
   - From the list of phrases, identify those that consist entirely of alphanumeric characters. Convert every occurrence of 'z' to 'zz' in these valid phrases. Keep a dictionary where the keys are the original phrases and the values are the altered versions.

2. **Duplicate Removal and Evenness Check:**
   - Remove duplicates from the list of numbers. Determine which of these numbers are even using the modulus operator.

3. **Pattern Matching and Substring Rearrangement:**
   - For each altered phrase from step 1, and for each even number identified in step 2, create a new string by concatenating the phrase and the number as a string. 
   - Check if these new strings can be rearranged to form any segment of the special pattern provided. Return a boolean indicating the possibility of rearrangement.

4. **Complex Output Construction:**
   - Return a dictionary where the keys are the original alphanumeric phrases, and the values are tuples. Each tuple contains the altered phrase, a list of even numbers identified, and whether or not a rearrangement of the combined string can match a segment of the special pattern.

This challenge integrates core concepts such as alphanumeric verification, string manipulation, deduplication and parity checking in number arrays, string concatenation, and substring rearrangement capability, offering a comprehensive task that taps into various programming skills.
