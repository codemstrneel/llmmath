QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that combines elements of tuple manipulation, numeric comparison, and string processing. The function should take two inputs: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string and two integers, and an integer `k`. The task is as follows:

1. Group the tuples based on the first letter of the string (case-insensitive). Tuples with the same starting letter should be combined into a list.
2. For each group, count how many tuples have their two integers being exactly `k` units apart.
3. Within each group, find the longest string from the tuples in that group where the string does not contain multiple consecutive spaces.
4. Return a dictionary where the keys are the starting letters (in lowercase) of the original strings, and the values are tuples containing:
   - The count of tuples with their integers exactly `k` units apart.
   - The longest valid string from the tuples in that group.

For example, given the input list of tuples `[("apple", 3, 5), ("aura", 7, 10), ("banana", 1, 1), ("beta", 2, 5)]` and `k = 2`, the output should be: `{'a': (1, "apple"), 'b': (0, "banana")}`.

        valid_count = sum(1 for _, num1, num2 in tuples if abs(num1 - num2) == k)
        
        # Find the longest string without multiple consecutive spaces

            if '  ' not in string and len(string) > len(longest_string):
                longest_string = string
        
        # Add entry to the result dictionary
        result[key] = (valid_count, longest_string)
