QUESTION

Write a python function that takes a tuple of integers and a positive integer target as input. The function should first calculate the product of all the numbers in the tuple. Then, determine the number of ways the product can be formed as a sum of a subset of given coin denominations provided in a list, ensuring that no two combinations of coins should have the same multi-set of coin denominations, but may differ in order. Return the count of possible ways.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this, you need to calculate the product of all integers in the tuple and then find the number of ways to represent this product as a sum using the given coin denominations, ensuring no duplicate combinations (ignoring the order of coins). Here is the implementation:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(nums, target, coins):
    """
    nums: A tuple of integers
    target: A positive integer representing the target product value
    coins: A list of integers representing coin denominations

    Returns the number of ways the target product can be formed as a sum of the coin denominations.
    """
    from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
    from math import prod

    # Calculate the product of all numbers in the tuple
    product = prod(nums)

    # If the product is zero, return 0 because we cannot represent zero as a sum of positive integers.
    if product == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Use combinations_with_replacement to find all possible combinations that sum up to the product
    coins = sorted(coins)  # Sort coins to ensure uniqueness when comparing sets
    ways = set()

    # We only need to consider combinations up to length product//min(coins)+1
    # because that's the maximum number of the smallest coin required to sum to the product
    for r in range(1, product // min(coins) + 1):
        for combination in combinations_with_replacement(coins, r):
            if sum(combination) == product:
                ways.add(tuple(sorted(combination)))

    return len(ways)
