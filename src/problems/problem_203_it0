QUESTION

Write a function that accepts a list of integers and a target sum. First, pack consecutive duplicate integers into sublists, then sort each of these sublists numerically. Identify the largest distinct value from each sorted sublist. After obtaining these values, attempt to find three unique largest values from different sublists whose product is the second smallest among all possible products greater than zero. If such a combination exists and its sum equals the target, return the tuple of these three values along with their product. Otherwise, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this task, we follow a structured approach:
1. We first compress consecutive duplicates in the list into sublists.
2. Then, each sublist is sorted.
3. From each sorted sublist, we select the largest distinct value.
4. Next, we generate all possible combinations of triplets from the selected distinct values.
5. We then compute the product of each triplet and determine the second smallest product among these. We also filter such products that are greater than zero.
6. Finally, if the sum of the elements in the selected triplet is equal to the target sum, we return the triplet along with its product; otherwise, return -1.

Here's the solution implementing the described approach:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
from itertools import groupby
from itertools import combinations
from typing import List, Union

def solution(nums: List[int], target: int) -> Union[int, tuple]:
    # Step 1: Pack consecutive duplicates into sublists
    grouped = [list(g) for k, g in groupby(nums)]
    
    # Step 2: Sort each sublist and pick the largest element
    largest_values = [sorted(g)[-1] for g in grouped]
    
    # Step 3: Generate all combinations of triplets from largest values
    triplets = list(combinations(largest_values, 3))
    
    # Step 4: Compute the products and find the second smallest product > 0
    valid_triplets = [(a, b, c, a * b * c) for (a, b, c) in triplets if (a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0)]
    valid_triplets.sort(key=lambda x: x[3])
    
    for i in range(len(valid_triplets)):
        if i > 0 and valid_triplets[i][3] != valid_triplets[i-1][3]:
            # Check the sum condition
            if valid_triplets[i][0] + valid_triplets[i][1] + valid_triplets[i][2] == target:
                return (valid_triplets[i][0], valid_triplets[i][1], valid_triplets[i][2], valid_triplets[i][3])
    
    return -1
<|Solution End|>
<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_basic_case():
    assert solution([2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5], 12) == (3, 4, 5, 60)

def test_solution_no_triplet_sum_equal_target():
    assert solution([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4], 20) == -1

def test_solution_single_large_triplet():
    assert solution([3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], 18) == (3, 6, 9, 162)

def test_solution_including_zero():
    assert solution([0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6, 6], 12) == (2, 4, 6, 48)

def test_solution_with_negatives():
    assert solution([-2, -2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 9, 9], 18) == (4, 5, 9, 180)

def test_solution_edge_case_minimal():
    assert solution([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7], 15) == -1

def test_solution_no_possibility():
    assert solution([1,1,1,1,1,1], 10) == -1
<|Test End|>
```

Here, the unit tests verify different scenarios: basic cases, cases where no valid triplet exists, including triplets that involve zero or negative numbers, and more edge considerations.
