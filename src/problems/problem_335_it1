QUESTION

Create a function that takes a dictionary and an integer n as input. The dictionary has strings as keys and lists of integers as values. The function should first compute the sum of the integers in each list and find the highest product of two sums among all the lists. Then for each original list, replicate that list's sum n times, and add these replicated sums to a list. Return a tuple containing this list and the highest product previously calculated.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the test results, the test for negative values has failed. This indicates there might be an issue in how products are being calculated or compared when negative values are involved. Let's investigate the solution and ensure it handles these cases correctly. I will adjust the solution or the test to handle cases with negative sums more accurately.

### Analysis & Solution

The problem statement requires calculating the highest product of two sums from the list of sums derived from the dictionary values. When both sums are negative, their product becomes positive. Current logic doesn't handle the cases where both operands are negative correctly as `max_product` starts from negative infinity. Moreover, the function should handle a case where only one distinct sum exists by returning the product of that sum squared.

Here is the revised solution and test cases ensuring proper handling:

    """

    """
    # Dictionary to hold sums of each list
    sums = {key: sum(value) for key, value in d.items()}
    
    # List of sums
    sums_list = list(sums.values())
    
    # If there are less than 2 sums, return the indicative product for no valid product.
    if len(sums_list) < 2:
        max_product = float('-inf') if not sums_list else sums_list[0] ** 2
    else:
        # Compute the highest product of two different sums
        max_product = max(sums_list[i] * sums_list[j] for i in range(len(sums_list)) for j in range(i + 1, len(sums_list)))

    # Replicate each sum n times
    replicated_sums = []
    for value_sum in sums_list:
        replicated_sums.extend([value_sum] * n)

    return (replicated_sums, max_product)

These refined tests and solution should handle all edge cases, including `float('-inf')` for cases where no valid product can be calculated, and ensuring sums and their products are correctly represented when negative numbers are involved.
