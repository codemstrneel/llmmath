QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that combines parsing of structured strings with mathematical computations, reflecting the core concepts of parsing and arithmetic from the provided questions.

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a list of strings where each string represents a geometric figure in the format "LxWxH", where L, W, and H are integers indicating the length, width, and height respectively of a rectangular cuboid (a 3D box). Your task is to perform the following steps:

1. Parse the dimensions of each cuboid from the string and calculate the volume and surface area for each.
2. Identify the top two unique volumes among the cuboids. In the case of a tie in volume, consider them as unique for ranking purposes.
3. For each of these top two unique volumes, find all associated cuboids' surface areas and calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of each set of surface areas.
4. Return a list containing:
   - A dictionary for each of the top two unique volumes, where the key is the volume, and the value is the computed LCM of its associated surface areas.

Ensure the function handles cases such as an empty list input and lists where all cuboids have the same dimensions.

Example:

```python
def analyze_cuboid_volumes(cuboid_strings):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage
result = analyze_cuboid_volumes(["2x3x4", "1x1x1", "2x3x4", "2x2x2", "5x10x2"])
print(result)
# Output: [{24: LCM of surface areas for cuboids with volume 24}, {8: LCM of surface areas for cuboids with volume 8}]
```

This new problem combines parsing structured strings (like extracting 'L', 'W', 'H' from "LxWxH") and performing arithmetic operations based on these parsed values, with a focus on volume, surface area, and using least common multiples (LCM) as required.
