QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and performs the following tasks: First, it identifies and returns the positions of numbers that are both even and perfect squares. Second, it removes all lucid numbers from the list. Lastly, it shifts the first element of the modified list to the end of the list and returns the final modified list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the issues from the previous attempt and ensure the code compiles and runs correctly. The task involves:

1. Identifying numbers that are both even and perfect squares and returning their positions (indices).
2. Removing "lucid numbers" (as previously assumed, numbers that are palindromic) from the list.
3. Shifting the first element of the resulting list to the end.

I will write the solution and unit tests accordingly, ensuring the output format is correct.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

def is_lucid_number(n):
    # Assuming "lucid number" to be the same as a palindromic number
    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]

def solution(numbers):
    even_and_square_indices = [i for i, n in enumerate(numbers) if n % 2 == 0 and is_perfect_square(n)]
    modified_numbers = [n for n in numbers if not is_lucid_number(n)]
    
    if modified_numbers:
        modified_numbers.append(modified_numbers.pop(0))
    
    return even_and_square_indices, modified_numbers
```

```python
def test_solution_finds_even_square_positions():
    # Test for positions of even perfect squares
    numbers = [4, 16, 18, 20, 25]
    indices, _ = solution(numbers)
    assert indices == [0, 1], f"Expected [0, 1] but got {indices}"

def test_solution_removes_lucid_numbers():
    # Test for removal of palindromic numbers
    numbers = [121, 202, 303, 16]
    _, modified = solution(numbers)
    assert modified == [16], f"Expected [16] but got {modified}"

def test_solution_shifts_first_element():
    # Test for shifting first element
    numbers = [10, 11, 12]
    _, modified = solution(numbers)
    assert modified == [11, 12, 10], f"Expected [11, 12, 10] but got {modified}"

def test_solution_handles_empty_list():
    # Test for empty list
    numbers = []
    indices, modified = solution(numbers)
    assert indices == [], "Expected no indices for an empty list"
    assert modified == [], "Expected empty list after processing empty list"

def test_solution_handles_no_lucid_numbers():
    # Test when there are no palindromic numbers
    numbers = [22, 33, 44, 16]
    indices, modified = solution(numbers)
    assert indices == [3], f"Expected [3] but got {indices}"
    assert modified == [44, 16, 22], f"Expected [44, 16, 22] but got {modified}"

def test_solution_no_even_perfect_squares_or_lucid_numbers():
    # Test when there are no even perfect squares or lucid numbers
    numbers = [3, 5, 7]
    indices, modified = solution(numbers)
    assert indices == [], "Expected empty indices"
    assert modified == [5, 7, 3], f"Expected [5, 7, 3] but got {modified}"

def test_solution_all_palindromic_numbers():
    # Test when all numbers are palindromic
    numbers = [121, 22, 33]
    _, modified = solution(numbers)
    assert modified == [], "Expected empty list as output"
```
<|Test End|>

This updated solution and its tests should now handle the task correctly and verify the implementation's correctness.
