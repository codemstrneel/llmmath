QUESTION

Write a function to generate a square matrix filled with consecutive integers starting from 1 in spiral order, and then compute the area of the tetrahedron formed by taking the first four distinct integers at the corners of the resulting matrix as the lengths of the edges.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Upon review, it seems that the approach to compute the volume of the tetrahedron was being used incorrectly. The values for the edges were not correctly configured to form a valid tetrahedron. Let's simplify this issue. We will generate the spiral matrix correctly and then employ the corner values. Instead of using a complex formula for volume that assumes specific alignments, we will ensure that calculation simplifies for tetrahedron validity.

Also, some parts of the defined edge calculations seem to be causing issues when the matrix size was lower than expected scenarios to form a valid tetrahedron. I'll rectify the situation and properly test these scenarios:

1. Fix the errors in the calculation of edge lengths.
2. Generate plausible unit tests to verify correctness.

I'll make necessary changes and provide a robust solution with updated tests:
