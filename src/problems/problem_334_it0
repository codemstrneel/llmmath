QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of tuples and a dictionary as input. The list of tuples should be chunked into sublists, each containing a maximum of n tuples, such that the sum of the integers in each tuple does not exceed a threshold t. Simultaneously, convert each key in the dictionary from camel case to snake case using a regular expression and replace the associated values with a list where each element is repeated n times using the map function. Return the modified list of sublists and the transformed dictionary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address this problem, we need to create a function that processes both a list of tuples and a dictionary. Here's how we can tackle the problem step by step:

1. **Chunking the List of Tuples**: We will chunk the list into sublists with a maximum of `n` tuples each, making sure that the sum of the elements in each tuple does not exceed the threshold `t`.

2. **Transforming the Dictionary**:
   - Convert each dictionary key from camel case to snake case using regular expressions.
   - Replace each value in the dictionary with a list where each element of the list is repeated `n` times using the `map` function.

Let's implement the solution with detailed code:

    def to_snake_case(name):
        """
        Convert camelCase to snake_case.
        """
        s1 = re.sub(r'(.)([A-Z][a-z]+)', r'\1_\2', name)
        snake_case_name = re.sub(r'([a-z0-9])([A-Z])', r'\1_\2', s1).lower()
        return snake_case_name
    
    def chunk_tuples(lst, chunk_size, threshold):
        """
        Chunk a list of tuples into sublists with a maximum of chunk_size tuples,
        without any sublist's elements' sum exceeding threshold.
        """
        res = []
        current_chunk = []
        current_sum = 0
        
        for tpl in lst:
            tpl_sum = sum(tpl)
            if len(current_chunk) < chunk_size and current_sum + tpl_sum <= threshold:
                current_chunk.append(tpl)
                current_sum += tpl_sum
            else:
                res.append(current_chunk)
                current_chunk = [tpl]
                current_sum = tpl_sum

            # Ensure last chunk is added
            if len(current_chunk) == chunk_size or sum(tpl) > threshold:
                res.append(current_chunk)
                current_chunk = []
                current_sum = 0

        if current_chunk:
            res.append(current_chunk)
        
        return res
    
    # Process the list of tuples
    modified_list = chunk_tuples(list_of_tuples, n, t)
    
    # Transform the dictionary
    modified_dict = {}
    for key, value in dictionary.items():
        new_key = to_snake_case(key)
        new_value = list(map(lambda x: [x] * n, value))
        flattened_value = [item for sublist in new_value for item in sublist]
        modified_dict[new_key] = flattened_value
    
    return modified_list, modified_dict
