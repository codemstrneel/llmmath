QUESTION

**Novel Combined Question:**

Create a Python function that processes two inputs: a matrix of tuples and a sentence. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Reverse the words in the sentence while maintaining the original casing of each letter.

2. In the matrix, remove similar rows by considering rows duplicates if they contain the same set of numbers (regardless of order).

3. For each unique row in the matrix, perform the following operations:

   - Calculate the sum of all integers in the row, and then check if this sum can be expressed as the sum of two distinct squares of non-negative integers, ensuring neither is zero.

   - For the reversed sentence, iterate over each word and check if the length of the word matches any integer in a row. If a match exists, mark the word with a hash prefix ('#').

4. Return a list of tuples where each element corresponds to a row in the matrix. Each tuple contains two elements:

   - A boolean indicating if the sum condition is satisfied.
   - The transformed sentence with marked words as described above.

### Example:

Given the sentence and matrix:

```python
sentence = "Hello world from developers"

matrix = [
    [(3, 5)], 
    [(4, 9)], 
    [(5, 3)], 
    [(3, 4)],
    [(1, 0)]
]
```

**Processing Steps:**

- Reverse the words in the sentence: "olleH dlrow morf srepoleved"

- Remove duplicate rows in terms of sets: [(3, 5)], [(4, 9)], [(1, 0)]

- Calculate sums and apply the condition:
    - For row [(3, 5)], sum is 8. Expressible as (2, 2) since 8 = 2² + 2². "olleH" and "dlrow" have lengths 5, matching an integer in the row.
    - For row [(4, 9)], sum is 13. Expressible as (2, 3) since 13 = 2² + 3². "srepoleved" has a length 10 that matches no integer in the row.
    - For row [(1, 0)], sum is 1. Cannot be expressed as the sum of two distinct squares.

**Result:**

```python
[
    (True, "#olleH #dlrow morf srepoleved"), 
    (True, "olleH dlrow morf srepoleved"), 
    (False, "olleH dlrow morf srepoleved")
]
```

This problem combines reversing words while preserving casing, row deduplication logic, and mathematical operations involving sums of squares, with a conditional word transformation based on integer lengths.
