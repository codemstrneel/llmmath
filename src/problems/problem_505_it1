QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a string and performs the following tasks: First, extract all numbers from the string and store both the numbers and their respective positions. Second, filter these numbers to find those that are both even and perfect squares. Return a tuple where the first element is a list of these numbers with their original positions in the string, and the second element is another list where the first number is moved to the end of the list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Your test cases and solution need some adjustments based on the feedback from the test execution. The test failures indicate there are issues with how numbers are extracted and processed. Let's ensure the test cases adequately cover the scenarios, and fix any issues in the solution.

1. **Fix the Issues in the Solution**: 
   - The example case in the solution might incorrectly expect particular positions that were messed up, as indicated by your test outputs.
   - Ensure that indexing (positions) is accurately captured right after extracting numbers.

2. **Revise Unit Test Cases**:
   - Review test cases for assumptions, especially concerning position values.
   - Align expectations with how the solution processes input strings.

Below is the corrected solution and updated test cases.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(s):
    import re
    from math import isqrt

    # Extract numbers with their positions
    numbers_positions = [(int(match.group()), match.start()) for match in re.finditer(r'\d+', s)]

    # Function to check if a number is a perfect square
    def is_perfect_square(n):
        return n == isqrt(n) ** 2

    # Filter for even perfect squares
    even_perfect_squares = [(number, pos) for number, pos in numbers_positions if number % 2 == 0 and is_perfect_square(number)]

    # Move the first element to the end of the list
    if even_perfect_squares:
        rearranged = even_perfect_squares[1:] + even_perfect_squares[:1]
    else:
        rearranged = []

    return even_perfect_squares, rearranged

def test_example_case():
    assert solution("The numbers are 4, 16, and 25.") == ([(4, 16), (16, 22)], [(16, 22), (4, 16)])

def test_no_numbers():
    assert solution("This string has no numbers") == ([], [])

    assert solution("Numbers like 10000 and 65536 are interesting.") == ([(10000, 12), (65536, 24)], [(65536, 24), (10000, 12)])

def test_zero_as_even_perfect_square():
    assert solution("Zero 0 is a number too.") == ([(0, 5)], [(0, 5)])

def test_mixed_content():
    assert solution("Check 4 1024 5 4096 quick") == ([(4, 6), (1024, 8), (4096, 13)], [(1024, 8), (4096, 13), (4, 6)])

<|Test End|>

The provided solution should correctly extract and process numbers, identify those which are even and perfect squares, and rearrange them as specified. The positions are derived from the beginning of the numbers based on the re.finditer function, ensuring the solution aligns with expected position values.
