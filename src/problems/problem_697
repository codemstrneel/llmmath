QUESTION

Based on the combination of concepts from the questions you provided, here is a novel coding question that integrates elements from multiple problems, focusing on string manipulation, mathematical calculations, and list operations:

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that receives two inputs: a list of strings and an integer `m`. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify all strings that contain a prime number of vowels. Compute the concatenated length of these strings and determine if this total length is a perfect square.
   
2. From these strings, construct a single string by interleaving their characters (e.g., if the strings are "abc" and "de", the result should be "adbce"). Then, count how many times the most common character appears in this interleaved string.

3. Return a dictionary with:
   - The key `"perfect_square"` holding a boolean that indicates whether the concatenated length of the strings with a prime number of vowels forms a perfect square.
   - The key `"most_common_count"` containing the count of occurrences of the most common character in the interleaved string.

Handle edge cases such as when no strings have a prime number of vowels or when the list is empty. Also, consider the scenario where `m` is less than the possible number of characters for interleaving or exceeds the total length.

This question combines string analysis (counting vowels and characters), mathematical checks (prime numbers, perfect squares), and list operations, providing a comprehensive problem-solving exercise.
