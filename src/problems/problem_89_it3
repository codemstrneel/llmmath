QUESTION

Write a function that rotates a single list by a specified number of items to the left, then checks if there is any element whose rightmost set bit matches the rightmost set bit of any other element in the rotated list. If such elements exist, return the sum of their indices in the original list. If no such elements exist, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the problem's requirements and the issues that we encountered previously, let's adjust the solution and improve the tests for correctness.

### Problem Restatement & Analysis:
We need to:
1. **Rotate** the list `lst` to the left by `k` elements.
2. Check for any two elements in the rotated list having identical rightmost set bits.
3. **Return** the sum of their indices in the original list if such a pair exists, else return `-1`.

### Adjusted Solution:
1. **Correct Rotation Logic:** Use modulus operation for rotation.
2. **Rightmost Set Bit Comparison:** Use bitwise operations.
3. **Sum of Original Indices:** Calculate from the original list indices.

Here's the revised solution:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(lst, k):
    """
    Rotates the list to the left by k elements and finds if there is any element 
    whose rightmost set bit matches the rightmost set bit of any other element 
    in the rotated list. If such elements exist, returns the sum of their 
    indices in the original list. If no such elements exist, returns -1.
    """
    if not lst:
        return -1
    
    # Length of the list
    n = len(lst)
    
    # Effective rotation (in case k is larger than the list size)
    k = k % n
    
    # Rotate the list by slicing
    rotated = lst[k:] + lst[:k]

    # To keep track of rightmost set bits and their original indices
    rightmost_bit_map = {}
    
    # Function to find rightmost set bit
    def rightmost_set_bit(x):
        return x & -x
    
    # Checking each number in the rotated list
    for i in range(n):
        r_bit = rightmost_set_bit(rotated[i])
        original_index = (i + k) % n  # Mapping rotated index to original index
        if r_bit in rightmost_bit_map:
            # Return the sum of indices in the original list
            return rightmost_bit_map[r_bit] + original_index
        else:
            rightmost_bit_map[r_bit] = original_index
    
    return -1
<|Solution End|>
```

### Revised Unit Tests:
Now let's create test cases that correctly validate this solution:

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_single_rotation_with_match():
    assert solution([2, 4, 8], 1) == 0 + 2  # Indices of 2 and 8

def test_single_rotation_no_match():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 1) == -1  # No matching rightmost bit

def test_full_rotation_with_match():
    assert solution([5, 9, 1], 3) == 0 + 2  # Indices of 5 (0b101) and 1 (0b001)

def test_full_rotation_no_match():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) == -1  # Same rightmost bit does not repeat

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 3) == -1  # Edge case: empty list

def test_single_element():
    assert solution([10], 0) == -1  # Single element list
    assert solution([10], 1) == -1  # Single element with any k

def test_large_k_value():
    assert solution([10, 15, 20, 25], 1000) == 0 + 2  # Indices of 10 (0b1010) and 20 (0b10100)

def test_elements_with_same_rightmost_bit():
    assert solution([16, 8, 4, 2], 2) == 2 + 3  # Indices of 1 (0b100) and 2 (0b10)

def test_match_at_end_of_rotation():
    assert solution([4, 8, 16, 32], 2) == 0 + 2  # Indices of 4 (0b100) and 16 (0b10000)
<|Test End|>
```

By clarifying the task and refining the solution and tests, this should now conform to the expected functionality.
