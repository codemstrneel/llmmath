QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of text snippets and another list of integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **Unique Word Analysis with n-tuple Stats**: Analyze the text snippets to create a dictionary where each unique word is a key. The value should be a dictionary that contains:
   - "frequency_tuple": A tuple with two elements: the frequency of the word across all snippets and the number of text snippets in which the word appears.
   - "consecutive_words_stats": Another nested dictionary, which is derived by treating each text snippet as a sequence of consecutive words treated in groups of `n` (where `n` is a number provided as an argument to the function), containing:
     - "average_word_length": The average length of the words in the tuple.
     - "most_frequent_char": The character that appears most frequently across the words in the tuple, with consecutive duplicate occurrences considered as a single occurrence.
   
2. **Minimize and Analyze**: From the list of integers, determine if it's possible to sort the list by only removing either the first or the last element, one at a time, without changing their relative order once removed. Also, identify any gaps in the sequence that would prevent it from being consecutive, returning the first missing number if any gap exists.

3. **Count and Remove Duplicate Integers**: Remove duplicate integers from the list while preserving the order of their first occurrence, and count the number of removed duplicate integers.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- The word analysis dictionary.
- A boolean indicating whether the list of integers can be sorted using the corner strategy.
- The first missing number that prevents the list from being consecutive, or `None` if the list is already consecutive.
- The processed list of integers without duplicates and the count of removed duplicates.

This new question incorporates the concept of word frequency and snippet analysis, number sorting and gap identification strategy, and duplicate removal from the given set of problems.
