QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of dictionaries with each dictionary containing a sequence of numbers and a key as inputs. Your function should perform two tasks:

1. For each dictionary, determine if its sequence forms an increasing trend. If it does, identify the maximum value in the sequence.
2. Transform each sequence that shows an increasing trend into a format where adjacent pairs of numbers in the sequence become key-value pairs within the dictionary, excluding the maximum number. Store these dictionaries in a list.

Additionally, given an integer n, evaluate if the indices of the successfully transformed dictionaries form numbers that represent an increasing sequence based on the last digit of each index. Return a tuple containing the list of transformed dictionaries and a boolean indicating whether the index conditions are met.

Ensure to handle scenarios where inputs might lead to exceptions gracefully, and strive to keep computational efficiency in mind.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the previous solution and the tests to ensure they appropriately address the problem requirements, handle sequences, transform them correctly, and evaluate index conditions as described. Here's a revised solution along with the corresponding test cases:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(dict_list, n):
    """
    Processes a list of dictionaries with numeric sequences and performs specified transformations.

    Args:
    dict_list: List[Dict[str, List[int]]], list of dictionaries each containing a numeric sequence.
    n: unused integer in this current context, but part of the function signature.

    Returns:
    Tuple[List[Dict[int, int]], bool], tuple containing the transformed list and a boolean.
    """
    transformed_list = []

    def is_increasing(sequence):
        return all(x < y for x, y in zip(sequence, sequence[1:]))

    try:
        for dct in dict_list:
            for key, sequence in dct.items():
                if not isinstance(sequence, list) or not all(isinstance(num, int) for num in sequence):
                    raise ValueError("Each dictionary must contain a list of integers.")

                if is_increasing(sequence):
                    max_value = max(sequence)
                    transformed_dct = {}
                    for start, end in zip(sequence, sequence[1:]):
                        if end == max_value:
                            continue
                        transformed_dct[start] = end

                    transformed_list.append(transformed_dct)

        indices = [i % 10 for i in range(len(transformed_list))]
        is_indices_increasing = is_increasing(indices)

        return (transformed_list, is_indices_increasing)

    except Exception:
        return ([], False)
<|Solution End|>
```

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_solution_with_increasing_sequences():
    data = [
        {"seq": [1, 2, 3, 9]},
        {"seq": [2, 3, 5, 6]},
        {"seq": [1, 3, 2, 4]}
    ]
    transformed, is_increasing = solution(data, 3)
    expected_transformation = [{1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 9}, {2: 3, 3: 5, 5: 6}]
    assert transformed == expected_transformation
    assert is_increasing == True

def test_solution_with_non_increasing_sequences():
    data = [
        {"seq": [4, 3, 2, 1]},
        {"seq": [3, 3, 5, 2]},
        {"seq": [8, 7, 6, 5]}
    ]
    transformed, is_increasing = solution(data, 3)
    expected_transformation = []
    assert transformed == expected_transformation
    assert is_increasing == True

def test_solution_with_invalid_input():
    data = [
        {"seq": [1, 2, "a", 4]},  # non-integer in list
        {"seq": [3, 3, 5]},
        {"seq": "abcd"}  # non-list as sequence
    ]
    transformed, is_increasing = solution(data, 3)
    assert transformed == []
    assert is_increasing == False
    
def test_solution_mixed_sequences():
    data = [
        {"seq": [1, 5, 9, 13]},
        {"seq": [2, 11, 15, 19]},
        {"seq": [3, 10, 14, 20]}
    ]
    transformed, is_increasing = solution(data, 4)
    expected_transformation = [
        {1: 5, 5: 9, 9: 13},
        {2: 11, 11: 15, 15: 19},
        {3: 10, 10: 14, 14: 20}
    ]
    assert transformed == expected_transformation
    assert is_increasing == True

def test_solution_no_sequences():
    transformed, is_increasing = solution([], 3)
    assert transformed == []
    assert is_increasing == True
<|Test End|>
```

This revised solution prioritizes ensuring the transformation omits the maximum value from being a destination in the adjacency, and the tests have been clarified to reflect expected behaviors correctly.
