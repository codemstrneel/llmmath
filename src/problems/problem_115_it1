QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of tuples and a target integer as its input. Each tuple in the list contains three elements: two integers and a sub-tuple. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each main tuple, use the two integers to:
   - Check if they add up to an odd number using bitwise operators. If they do, continue to the next step; otherwise, skip to the next main tuple.
   - Determine if they can represent the side lengths of a valid triangle. If they cannot form a valid triangle, skip to the next main tuple.

2. From each sub-tuple (which contains several integers), identify all sublists of length three, if present. For each of these sublists:
   - Calculate the area of a rhombus using the first two integers, assuming the diagonals of the rhombus are twice the values of these integers.
   - Check if the third integer equals the target integer, and increment a counter for each occurrence.

3. Return a dictionary with:
   - "valid_rhombus_areas": a list of computed rhombus areas from step 2.
   - "target_count": the total count of how many times the target integer appeared as the third element in each chosen sublist.

Ensure all pairwise elements in the sub-tuple can be used in a manner that considers the constraints described, and assume all integers are positive.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The last test results indicate that there is an issue with the `solution` function implementation or with the test expectations. Let's review the problem, the solution, and the test logic to correct them.

### Solution Review:
#### Key Requirements:
1. **Odd Sum Check**: Using bitwise XOR followed by logical AND.
2. **Triangle Validity**: Using the condition that neither side should be zero, and their sum should be greater than one (though practically, it should be that both sides can form a triangle in conjunction with a possible third sideâ€”ensured by inequality checks, which might be relaxed since only those two sides are given directly).
3. **Rhombus Area Calculation**: The diagonals (double the side lengths of the sublists) to compute rhombus areas are calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = 0.5 \times (2 \times a) \times (2 \times b)
   \]

#### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Triangle Check**: Should verify any practical non-zero, non-identical sides.
2. **Rhombus Area and Target Count**: Ensure appropriate computation separation.
3. **Ensure Complete Logic Alignment with Task**: Validate test correctness.
   
Here's an updated attempt considering these refinements:

        return a > 0 and b > 0 and a + b > a and a + b > b

        return (a ^ b) & 1

    valid_rhombus_areas = []
    target_count = 0

    for main_tuple in lst:
        x, y, subtuple = main_tuple
        if not is_odd_sum(x, y):
            continue
        if not can_form_triangle(x, y):
            continue

        rhombus_area_coefficient = 0.5
        for i in range(len(subtuple) - 2):
            a, b, c = subtuple[i], subtuple[i+1], subtuple[i+2]
            area = rhombus_area_coefficient * (2 * a) * (2 * b)
            valid_rhombus_areas.append(area)
            if c == target:
                target_count += 1

    return {
