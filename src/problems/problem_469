SOL & TESTS

<|Solution Begin|>```python
def product_of_odds(a, b):
    """
    Returns the product of all odd natural numbers between a and b, inclusive.
    If there are no odd numbers in the range, returns 1.
    """
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    product = 1
    for num in range(a, b + 1):
        if num % 2 != 0:
            product *= num
    return product
