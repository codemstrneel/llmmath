QUESTION

Write a function to convert a list of strings representing numbers into a tuple of floating-point numbers, ensuring that the strings can contain scientific notation and handle cases where the conversion might fail by raising a custom exception.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The repeated syntax errors in previous attempts were due to formatting issues within the markup blocks. Let's ensure that the code is defined correctly within the code blocks without additional markup syntax inside them. I'll adjust the solution and tests accordingly:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(strings):
    """
    Converts a list of numeric strings into a tuple of floats.
    Raises ValueError if any string can't be converted.
    """
    try:
        return tuple(float(num_str) for num_str in strings)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("One or more strings could not be converted to a float.")
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution
import pytest

def test_strings_to_floats_with_regular_numbers():
    assert solution(["1", "2", "3.5"]) == (1.0, 2.0, 3.5)

def test_strings_to_floats_with_scientific_notation():
    assert solution(["1e1", "2.5e-1", "3E4"]) == (10.0, 0.25, 30000.0)

def test_strings_to_floats_with_mixed_notations():
    assert solution(["1e2", "3.5", "6.02e23"]) == (100.0, 3.5, 6.02e23)

def test_strings_to_floats_with_invalid_strings():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="One or more strings could not be converted to a float."):
        solution(["1e1", "abc", "3.5"])

def test_strings_to_floats_with_empty_strings():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="One or more strings could not be converted to a float."):
        solution(["", "2.5", "0.01"])

def test_strings_to_floats_with_includes_spaces():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="One or more strings could not be converted to a float."):
        solution(["3.5", " 1e1 ", "2.5.8"])

def test_strings_to_floats_with_non_numeric_characters():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="One or more strings could not be converted to a float."):
        solution(["10", "-.5", "twenty"])
```
<|Test End|>

Please note that these code blocks should now be correctly formatted for execution. You can run them in your Python environment with `pytest` to verify their functionality.
