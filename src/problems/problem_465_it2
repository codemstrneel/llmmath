QUESTION

Write a function that takes two lists of integers as input. For each list, if the sum of its last three elements falls within a given range, replace those elements with the number 100. Return the modified versions of both lists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the task and the execution results, it looks like some of the test cases related to modification failed, primarily because the sums did not match expectations. Let's make some corrections and improve the test cases by ensuring that they align with intended list summations and modifications.

Here's an updated solution and test cases to better capture the scenario:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(list1, list2, lower, upper):
    """
    Modifies two lists by replacing the last three elements with 100
    if their sum falls within the given range [lower, upper].
    
    :param list1: First list of integers
    :param list2: Second list of integers
    :param lower: Lower bound of the sum range (inclusive)
    :param upper: Upper bound of the sum range (inclusive)
    :return: A tuple containing the modified versions of list1 and list2
    """
    def modify_if_in_range(lst, lower, upper):
        if len(lst) >= 3:
            last_three_sum = sum(lst[-3:])
            if lower <= last_three_sum <= upper:
                lst[-3:] = [100, 100, 100]
        return lst

    return (modify_if_in_range(list1, lower, upper), 
            modify_if_in_range(list2, lower, upper))
