QUESTION

Here is a novel question that combines core concepts from the provided coding questions:

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and a list of integers as input. The function should perform the following operations:

1. For each string, use a regex pattern to extract all substrings that contain two alternating characters. Collect these substrings into a new list.
2. For each substring identified, calculate the product of its ASCII values.
3. Organize the list of these products into a tuple and sort it in descending order.
4. Using the list of integers, calculate all possible sublists (i.e., contiguous subarrays). For each sublist, compute the product of its elements.
5. Find the intersection of two sets: the first set contains the products of the ASCII values, and the second set contains the products of the integer sublists. Create a dictionary that counts the frequency of each intersecting product.
6. Split these intersecting products into chunks of size `m` (an additional parameter provided to the function) and return the chunked list along with the dictionary of frequencies.

This exercise combines concepts from regex substring extraction, ASCII value calculations, intersection of sets, and managing collections through sorting, chunking, and frequency counting.
