QUESTION

Write a Python function to check whether the given number is a perfect square or not, and verify if the next perfect square (if any) is a prime number.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve the problem, we need to implement a function that checks if a given number is a perfect square. If it is, the function should then determine if the next perfect square is a prime number.

Here's how we can implement the solution:

1. **Check if a number is a perfect square:** For a number `n`, it is a perfect square if its square root is an integer. In Python, you can compute this by taking the square root using `math.sqrt(n)` and checking if it is an integer.

2. **Find the next perfect square:** If `n` is a perfect square, then its integer square root `m = sqrt(n)` can be used to find the next perfect square as `(m + 1) ** 2`.

3. **Check if a number is prime:** A utility function can be derived to check primality by testing divisibility on numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number in question.

Here is the implementation of these steps encapsulated in the required solution function:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import math

def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a given number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def solution(n):
    """
    Check if n is a perfect square, and if so, check if the next
    perfect square is a prime number.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    if root * root == n: # n is a perfect square
        next_perfect_square = (root + 1) ** 2
        return is_prime(next_perfect_square)
    return False
<|Solution End|>
```

Now, let's ensure our solution does what it's supposed to by writing some unit tests:

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_perfect_square_is_prime():
    assert not solution(1)  # 1 is a perfect square, next is 4, not prime
    assert solution(9)      # 9 is a perfect square, next is 16, not prime
    assert not solution(16) # 16 is a perfect square, next is 25, not prime
    assert not solution(25) # 25 is a perfect square, next is 36, not prime

def test_not_perfect_square():
    assert not solution(2)
    assert not solution(3)
    assert not solution(5)
    assert not solution(7)

def test_large_perfect_square():
    assert solution(1_000_000)  # 1000^2 is 1000000, next is 1002001 (prime)

def test_negative_number():
    assert not solution(-4)  # Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares

def test_edge_cases():
    assert not solution(0)    # 0 is a perfect square, next is 1 (prime)
    assert not solution(-1)   # Negative number case
<|Test End|>
```

These tests cover:
- Checking several small perfect squares and their next perfect squares.
- Numbers that are not perfect squares.
- The behavior for large numbers and edge cases like negative numbers or zero.
