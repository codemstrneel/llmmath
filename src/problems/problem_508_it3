QUESTION

Write a Python function to determine how many values of \( x \) satisfy a given cubic equation within a specified integer range. The cubic equation will be provided in the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \), with integer coefficients \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). The range will also be specified with integer boundaries, \( \text{low} \) and \( \text{high} \), inclusive. Your function should count how many integer solutions exist within this range and return that count.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The current solution function correctly iterates over a specified integer range, evaluating a cubic polynomial to find solutions. However, a few test cases need adjustments to ensure correctness as the number of solutions and their ranges are not accurately covered. 

Let's fix the unit tests, especially focusing on the failed tests to ensure they use the correct polynomial whose solutions match the expected results.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(a, b, c, d, low, high):
    """
    Determines how many integer values of x satisfy the cubic equation
    ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 within the range [low, high].

    Parameters:
    - a, b, c, d: coefficients of the cubic equation.
    - low, high: the range in which to look for integer solutions.

    Returns:
    - The count of integer values of x that satisfy the equation within the range.
    """
    count = 0
    for x in range(low, high + 1):
        if a * x**3 + b * x**2 + c * x + d == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

from solution import solution

def test_solution_no_solution():
    # The equation x^3 + 1 = 0 has no integer solutions as x^3 can never be negative.
    assert solution(1, 0, 0, 1, -10, 10) == 0

def test_solution_one_solution():
    # The equation (x-1)^3 = 0 has one real root, x = 1.
    assert solution(1, -3, 3, -1, -10, 10) == 1

def test_solution_two_solutions():
    # The equation x^3 - x = 0 can be factored as x(x-1)(x+1), two solutions in range [-10, 10] are x = -1 and x = 1.
    assert solution(1, 0, -1, 0, -10, 10) == 2

def test_solution_three_solutions():
    # The equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 can be factored as (x-1)(x-2)(x-3), solutions are 1, 2, and 3.
    assert solution(1, -6, 11, -6, -10, 10) == 3

def test_solution_no_solution_out_of_range():
    # If searching range is 4 to 10, solutions 1, 2, 3 are out, so answer should be 0
    assert solution(1, -6, 11, -6, 4, 10) == 0

def test_solution_large_range():
    # The equation x^3 = 0 has only the solution x = 0.
    assert solution(1, 0, 0, 0, -10, 10) == 1

def test_solution_no_solution_in_negative_range():
    # Searching in a negative range with an equation x^3 = 0 results in no solutions since he solution is x = 0.
    assert solution(1, 0, 0, 0, -10, -1) == 0

def test_solution_all_zero_solution():
    # For equation 0 = 0, all integers are solutions. But we confined this to bounds [0, 0].
    assert solution(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) == 1

<|Test End|>

These tests now correctly account for different cases of solving the cubic equation over specified ranges, checking for no solutions, one solution, two solutions, among others, using carefully chosen polynomials.
