QUESTION

Write a function to find the maximum of two numbers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

## Solution

The task requires implementing a function that finds the maximum of two numbers. Below is the implementation using Python.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(a, b):
    """
    Returns the maximum of two numbers a and b.
    """
    return a if a > b else b
<|Solution End|>

## Unit Tests

Here are unit tests for the solution using pytest style. The tests check various scenarios to ensure the function works as expected.

<|Test Begin|>
def test_max_when_first_is_greater():
    assert solution(10, 5) == 10

def test_max_when_second_is_greater():
    assert solution(5, 10) == 10

def test_max_with_negative_numbers():
    assert solution(-10, -5) == -5

def test_max_with_equal_numbers():
    assert solution(7, 7) == 7

def test_max_with_zero_and_positive():
    assert solution(0, 5) == 5

def test_max_with_zero_and_negative():
    assert solution(-5, 0) == 0
<|Test End|>

These tests cover cases where the first number is larger, the second number is larger, both numbers are equal, as well as scenarios involving negative numbers and zero.
