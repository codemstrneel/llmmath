QUESTION

Write a function that takes two lists: a list of numbers and a list of strings. The function should return a new list where each element is a tuple. Each tuple should contain an index, the sum of polite numbers up to that index from the list of numbers, and a concatenation of the corresponding string from the list of strings with whether the number at that index has even or odd parity. If the lists differ in length, only process up to the length of the shorter list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears that there was a misunderstanding with how to present code within specific tags. Let's provide the solution and the tests correctly, using Python syntax, and ensuring they are within <|Solution Begin|>, <|Solution End|>, <|Test Begin|>, and <|Test End|> tags without unnecessary formatting symbols.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(numbers, strings):
    result = []
    cumulative_sum = 0
    for i in range(min(len(numbers), len(strings))):
        if numbers[i] % 2 == 0:
            cumulative_sum += numbers[i]
        parity = "even" if numbers[i] % 2 == 0 else "odd"
        combined_string = strings[i] + parity
        result.append((i, cumulative_sum, combined_string))
    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_with_equal_lengths():
    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    strings = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    assert solution(numbers, strings) == [
        (0, 2, "aeven"),
        (1, 2, "bodd"),
        (2, 6, "ceven"),
        (3, 6, "dodd")
    ]

def test_solution_with_different_lengths():
    numbers = [1, 4, 2]
    strings = ["x", "y"]
    assert solution(numbers, strings) == [
        (0, 0, "xodd"),
        (1, 4, "yeven"),
    ]

def test_solution_with_empty_lists():
    assert solution([], []) == []
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], []) == []
    assert solution([], ["x", "y", "z"]) == []

def test_solution_with_all_even_numbers():
    numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
    strings = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    assert solution(numbers, strings) == [
        (0, 2, "aeven"),
        (1, 6, "beven"),
        (2, 12, "ceven"),
        (3, 20, "deven")
    ]

def test_solution_with_all_odd_numbers():
    numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    strings = ["p", "q", "r", "s"]
    assert solution(numbers, strings) == [
        (0, 0, "podd"),
        (1, 0, "qodd"),
        (2, 0, "rodd"),
        (3, 0, "sodd")
    ]

# A helper import line for using the testing framework
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_solution_with_equal_lengths()
    test_solution_with_different_lengths()
    test_solution_with_empty_lists()
    test_solution_with_all_even_numbers()
    test_solution_with_all_odd_numbers()
    print("All tests passed!")
```
<|Test End|>

The solution function is expected to be standalone. The test functions are structured such that they do not need to import explicitly the 'solution', assuming they reside within the same script when run in a testing environment. If you wish to integrate with pytest smoothly, use `pytest` to execute the test functions, and the suite will discover functions prefixed with `test_` automatically. The added main guard at the end allows you to run tests directly when the script is executed as a standalone program.
