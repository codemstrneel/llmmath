QUESTION

Write a function that takes a camel case string representation of fractional numbers, converts it to a snake case string, and then sums the fractions as a single float.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The provided solution seems to have some issues. One major flaw is the incorrect assumption about what each fractional string component like "OneHalf" or "ThreeFifths" means. In the solution code, these components are directly parsed as fractions, without any actual mapping or conversion logic for words to actual fractional values.

Here is the proper solution that involves defining a mapping from words to fractional values.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import re
from fractions import Fraction

# Mapping from words to numerical fraction representations
word_to_fraction = {
    'oneHalf': Fraction(1, 2),
    'oneThird': Fraction(1, 3),
    'oneQuarter': Fraction(1, 4),
    'threeEighths': Fraction(3, 8),
    'threeFifths': Fraction(3, 5),
    'oneFifth': Fraction(1, 5),
    'oneSixth': Fraction(1, 6),
    'oneEighth': Fraction(1, 8),
    'oneTenth': Fraction(1, 10),
    'ninetyNineHundredths': Fraction(99, 100),
}

def solution(camel_case_string):
    """
    Converts a camel case string of fractional numbers to snake case, 
    parses the fractions, and returns their sum as a float.
    """
    # Step 1: Convert camelCase to underscore-separated list of words.
    # Create a regex pattern to find capital letters and convert them to "_lowercase"
    components = re.findall(r'[A-Z](?:[a-z]+|[A-Z]*(?=[A-Z]|$))', camel_case_string)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the sum of fractions
    total = sum(word_to_fraction.get(component.lower(), Fraction(0)) for component in components if component)
    
    # Step 3: Return the sum as a float
    return float(total)
```
<|Solution End|>

Now, let's write unit tests to properly validate this corrected implementation:

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_known_fractions():
    assert abs(solution("OneHalfOneThird") - (1/2 + 1/3)) < 1e-9
    assert abs(solution("OneQuarterThreeEighths") - (1/4 + 3/8)) < 1e-9

def test_single_fraction():
    assert abs(solution("ThreeFifths") - (3/5)) < 1e-9
    assert abs(solution("OneThird") - (1/3)) < 1e-9
    assert abs(solution("NinetyNineHundredths") - (99/100)) < 1e-9

def test_no_fractions():
    assert abs(solution("")) == 0.0

def test_mixed_cases():
    assert abs(solution("OneHalfOneThird") - (1/2 + 1/3)) < 1e-9

def test_complex_fractions():
    assert abs(solution("OneEighthOneSixteenth") - (1/8)) < 1e-9  # since "oneSixteenth" is not in the dictionary, it's 0
    assert abs(solution("OneTenthNinetyNineHundredths") - (1/10 + 99/100)) < 1e-9
```
<|Test End|>

The tests will ensure that given different combinations of camel case inputs corresponding to fractional words, the function accurately computes the sum of the fractions. Each assertion checks that the sum is within a small delta of the expected value to handle floating-point precision issues.
