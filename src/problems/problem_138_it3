QUESTION

Write a function to determine if a string is a permutation of a substring of another string, ensuring that the substring elements appear in the same relative order as they do in the larger string.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there have been some difficulties with the syntax used for testing. Let's take a step-by-step approach to ensure the solution and the accompanying tests are correctly formatted to run in an execution environment.

The task is to determine if the string `needle` is a substring of the string `haystack`. The solution provided ensures the entire sequence of the `needle` appears in `haystack` as a contiguous subsequence.

Let's rewrite the solution code and the tests, ensuring they're well-structured for proper execution:

<|Solution Begin|>

```python
def solution(needle, haystack):
    """
    Determines if `needle` is a contiguous substring of `haystack`
    appearing in the same relative order.
    """
    if not needle:
        return True  # An empty string is a substring of any string

    return needle in haystack
```

<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>

```python
def test_substring_present():
    assert solution("abc", "eidabcbao") == True

def test_no_substring():
    assert solution("abc", "eidboaoo") == False

def test_empty_needle():
    assert solution("", "eidciabbao") == True

def test_empty_haystack():
    assert solution("abc", "") == False

def test_long_needle():
    assert solution("abcdef", "abc") == False

def test_identical_strings():
    assert solution("abc", "abc") == True

def test_single_character_needle_haystack():
    assert solution("a", "a") == True
    assert solution("a", "b") == False

def test_case_sensitive():
    assert solution("a", "A") == False

def test_substring_at_the_end():
    assert solution("cba", "cbabcba") == True
```

<|Test End|>

The revised code checks if the `needle` is a substring of `haystack`, maintaining its order. The unit tests confirm it handles basic, edge, and diverse cases effectively. Make sure to execute these tests in an environment that supports Python code execution.
