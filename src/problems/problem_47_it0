QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains either a list of integers or a string. For each tuple that contains a list of integers, identify numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two squares, and calculate the half of such values using map and lambda functions. For each tuple that contains a string, check if it is a valid password based on predefined criteria. The function should return two lists: the first list contains tuples where each tuple is composed of the half-value of the identified numbers and a Boolean indicating if this number's double is within a specified range \( k \) to \( n \), and the second list contains Boolean values indicating whether the strings are valid passwords. Ensure that Fibonacci numbers up to the length of the longer list are calculated using recursion, and include these Fibonacci numbers as a set in the return value.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To tackle the problem, we need to create a solution that handles two types of elements within each tuple: a list of integers or a string. Here's how we will structure our solution:

1. **Processing List of Integers**: 
   - For each integer in the list, determine if it can be expressed as a sum of two squares. A number `x` can be expressed as a sum of two squares if, for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \), \( x = a^2 + b^2 \).
   - We need to calculate the half of these values using map and lambda.
   - Check if the original number (double the half value) is within a specified range \( k \) to \( n \).

2. **Processing Strings**: 
   - Check if a string meets certain password criteria such as length, presence of digits, uppercase/lowercase letters, and special characters.

3. **Calculating Fibonacci Numbers**: 
   - Use recursion to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to the length of the longer list of tuples, and include these Fibonacci numbers as a set in the return value.

The function will return two lists as stipulated, along with the Fibonacci number set.

Below is the implementation along with corresponding unit tests.

        if b*b == b_squared:
            return True
    return False
