QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a mixed list of integers and strings and returns a list of values extracted as follows: 

1. Check if each integer is a perfect square.
2. Extract strings that appear within quotation marks using regex.

The function should return a list of results consisting of boolean values indicating whether each integer is a perfect square and a list of extracted strings from the quoted sections. If an element doesn't fit either category, it should be ignored in the output.

For example, given the input list `[16, 'She said, "hello"', "Test 'this'", 5, '8']`, the function should return `[True, ['hello']]`.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the test results and failure reasons, I'll revise the previous solution and tests to ensure correctness and consistency with the requirements outlined in the question.

1. The tests should ensure the output list correctly reflects whether each integer in the input list is a perfect square, as well as extract strings from quotes using regex.

2. The structure of the output must consist of two lists: 
    - A list of booleans indicating whether each integer is a perfect square.
    - A list of strings extracted from quotes.

I'll adjust the solution and tests accordingly.

def solution(mixed_list: List[Union[int, str]]) -> List[Union[bool, List[str]]]:
    perfect_squares = []
    extracted_strings = []

    for item in mixed_list:
        if isinstance(item, int):
            # Check if the number is a perfect square
            if is_perfect_square(item):
                perfect_squares.append(True)
            else:
                perfect_squares.append(False)
        elif isinstance(item, str):
            # Extract quoted strings using regex
            quotes = re.findall(r'["\'](.*?)["\']', item)
            extracted_strings.extend(quotes)
    
    # Return a list containing perfect square booleans and a list of extracted strings
    if extracted_strings:
        return perfect_squares + [extracted_strings]
    else:
        return perfect_squares + [[]]

def is_perfect_square(number: int) -> bool:
    if number < 0:
        return False
    sqrt = math.isqrt(number)
    return sqrt * sqrt == number

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_mixed_list_with_perfect_squares_and_strings():
    assert solution([16, 'She said, "hello"', "Test 'this'", 5, '8']) == [True, ['hello', 'this']]

def test_if_no_strings_no_perfect_squares():
    assert solution([2, 3, 'Not "quoted"', 10]) == [False, False, [ ]]

def test_only_strings_with_quotes():
    assert solution(['"Quoted"', "'also'", 'Normal']) == [[], ['Quoted', 'also']]

def test_no_strings_no_integers():
    assert solution([[], {}, ()]) == [[]]

def test_all_input_types_with_perfect_squares():
    assert solution([1, 4, 9, 16, 'Test', 'Say "hi"', 'Nothing here']) == [True, True, True, True, ['hi']]

def test_empty_string_and_zero():
    assert solution(['', 0]) == [True, []]

def test_negative_numbers():
    assert solution([-1, -4, -9, '"Negative"']) == [False, False, False, ['Negative']]

This updated solution and unit tests should resolve any previous issues, ensuring the functionality matches the outlined requirements.
