QUESTION

Create a Python function that takes in three arguments: a list of strings, a list of numbers, and a third argument representing the minimum frequency threshold (a positive integer). The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Remove duplicate words from the list of strings, preserving the order of their first occurrences.
2. Count the frequency of numbers in the list of numbers where each consecutive occurrence of the same number is considered as one occurrence (e.g., [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1] would be [1, 2, 3, 1] in terms of frequency counting).
3. Only include numbers in the frequency dictionary that have a frequency greater than or equal to the given minimum frequency threshold.

The function should return a tuple containing the processed list of strings without duplicates and a dictionary representing the frequency count of the distinct consecutive numbers filtered by the threshold.
