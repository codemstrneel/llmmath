QUESTION

To create a novel question that combines core concepts from the given problems, let's integrate elements of tuple manipulation, character analysis, sequence constraints, and handling complex data structures:

**New Question:**

Write a function that performs the following tasks on a given list of tuples. Each tuple consists of a nested structure containing strings and integers:

1. Identify and remove all elements (both strings and integers) from the tuples that match an input list of specified elements. Ensure that the function can handle tuples with multiple nesting levels, removing all instances of the specified elements.

2. After the cleanup, find the tuple with the maximum sum of integer values, ensuring that no three consecutive elements were chosen from the cleaned structure to form this sum.

3. Using this tuple, extract subsequences of characters such that each subsequence has all identical characters. Collect these subsequences into a list.

4. Return a dictionary with the following keys:
   - "Cleaned Tuples": The list of cleaned tuples after element removal.
   - "Max Sum Tuple": The tuple with the maximum sum of non-consecutive integers.
   - "Subsequences": The list of character subsequences, ensuring no two subsequences share the same starting and ending characters from the original tuple, and each subsequence consists of at least one vowel.

This problem requires handling nested structures, performing tuple manipulation, sequence analysis, and applying constraints to achieve the required output.
