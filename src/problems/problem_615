QUESTION

Create a Python function that processes a matrix of tuples, where each tuple consists of a set of integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Eliminate duplicate rows, wherein two rows are considered duplicates if their sets of integers are identical.
2. For each unique row, calculate the lowercase string representation of the hexadecimal values of the XOR of each integer pair in the row.

The function should return a list of strings, each representing the result of the calculations for a unique row.

def process_matrix(matrix):
