QUESTION

Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as a sum of squares of two non-negative integers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's review and refine the solution and unit tests to ensure accurate results for whether a given number can be represented as a sum of squares of two non-negative integers.

We'll maintain the same solution logic and refine the tests per constraints we realize from attempts such as handling prime numbers correctly for this specific problem.

Here's the refined code:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n):
    """
    Checks if the number n can be represented as a sum of squares of two non-negative integers.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    a = 0
    while a * a <= n:
        b_square = n - a * a
        if int(b_square**0.5) ** 2 == b_square:
            return True
        a += 1
        
    return False
<|Solution End|>
```

And the revised test cases:

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_can_be_sum_of_squares():
    assert solution(5) == True  # 1^2 + 2^2 or 2^2 + 1^2
    assert solution(34) == True # 3^2 + 5^2 or 5^2 + 3^2
 
def test_cannot_be_sum_of_squares():
    assert solution(3) == False # Not expressible as sum of squares
    assert solution(7) == False # Not expressible as sum of squares
    assert solution(11) == False # Not expressible as sum of squares

def test_sum_of_squares_with_twin_squares():
    assert solution(1) == True  # 0^2 + 1^2 or 1^2 + 0^2
    assert solution(2) == True  # 1^2 + 1^2

def test_sum_of_squares_zero():
    assert solution(0) == True  # 0^2 + 0^2

def test_large_square():
    assert solution(1000000) == True  # 1000^2 + 0^2

def test_large_prime_that_fails():
    # Known large prime number that cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares.
    assert solution(999983) == False

<|Test End|>
```

### Explanation

- **Test Coverage**: 
  - The tests cover small numbers, a few select known non-representable numbers (like 3, 7, 11), and large numbers without prior checks on their composition, ensuring the implementation stands robust for given practical use.
  
- **Prime Handling**: We test with specific numbers, but for prime numbers being expressible as a sum of two squares, they need to be of specific forms, which is more of a mathematical theory focus beyond scope here.

- **Negative Numbers**: The solution assumes non-negative integers per problem description allowing safe disregard for negative inputs.

This solution and tests align with typical competitive programming environment expectations for handling sum-of-squares type problems.
