QUESTION

Write a function that creates a square matrix filled with the first n perfect squares, arranged in spiral order. After constructing the matrix, determine if the largest number in the matrix has the same number of digits as the smallest number, excluding zeros.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The previous attempts seem to have formatting issues in the test cases. Let's correct this and ensure we have robust unit tests to verify the solution.

We'll stick to testing the requirement that involves checking the number of non-zero digits in the smallest and largest perfect squares in the matrix. 

Let's start by ensuring the solution and test functions are appropriately formatted and valid Python syntax is used.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n):
    def generate_perfect_squares(size):
        """Generate a list of perfect squares up to size * size."""
        return [i * i for i in range(1, size * size + 1)]

    def fill_spiral(n, numbers):
        """Fill an n x n matrix in a spiral order with the given numbers."""
        if not numbers or n == 0:
            return []

        spiral_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        current_dir = 0
        r = c = 0

        for num in numbers:
            spiral_matrix[r][c] = num
            next_r, next_c = r + directions[current_dir][0], c + directions[current_dir][1]

            if 0 <= next_r < n and 0 <= next_c < n and spiral_matrix[next_r][next_c] == 0:
                r, c = next_r, next_c
            else:
                current_dir = (current_dir + 1) % 4
                r, c = r + directions[current_dir][0], c + directions[current_dir][1]

        return spiral_matrix

    def count_non_zero_digits(number):
        """Count non-zero digits in a number."""
        return len([d for d in str(number) if d != '0'])

    # Generate n * n perfect squares
    perfect_squares = generate_perfect_squares(n)
    
    # Fill the matrix in spiral order
    fill_spiral(n, perfect_squares)

    # Find the largest and smallest perfect squares
    largest = max(perfect_squares)
    smallest = min(perfect_squares)

    # Count non-zero digits
    largest_digits = count_non_zero_digits(largest)
    smallest_digits = count_non_zero_digits(smallest)

    # Determine if they have the same number of digits
    return largest_digits == smallest_digits
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_small_matrix():
    assert solution(1) == True  # Only number is 1, non-zero digit count is 1.

def test_solution_large_digit_difference():
    assert solution(2) == False # Smallest is 1 (1 digit), largest is 16 (2 digits).

def test_solution_three_by_three_matrix():
    assert solution(3) == False # Smallest is 1 (1 digit), largest is 81 (2 digits).

def test_solution_zero_exclusion():
    # Ensure proper digit exclusion with zeroes, even though there's no zero in perfect squares
    assert solution(11) == False # Testing a larger matrix

def test_solution_equality_of_digits():
    assert solution(10) == False # Given perfect squares matrix 1-digit vs 3-digit numbers
<|Test End|>
```

This unit test setup checks various sizes of matrices and their correct handling of number and digit computations. Each test is designed to check whether the largest and smallest numbers (excluding zeros in their digit calculations) have the same number of digits.
