QUESTION

Given the nature of the provided questions, let's create a new problem that combines elements from multiple questions, specifically integrating concepts from tuples and lists, as well as string processing:

---

**Question:**

Create a Python function `process_tuple_list` that takes as an input a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three elements: a number, a list of strings, and another number. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify the tuple where the first element (number) is the maximum among all first elements in the list of tuples.
2. Use a lambda function to filter the tuples where the length of the list of strings is equal to a given number \( n \).
3. For the tuples that pass this filter, check each string in the list to determine if all characters in the string are the same. Count how many strings satisfy this condition in each list.
4. For each filtered tuple's list of strings, merge the first and last characters of each string into a new string (ignoring strings with a single character).
5. Return a tuple containing:
   - The tuple with the maximum first element.
   - A list of counts representing, for each filtered tuple, how many strings contained only identical characters.
   - A list of lists, where each sublist contains the new merged strings for each original list of strings from the filtered tuples.

Given these requirements, ensure your function handles edge cases where the list may be empty, or tuples might include `None` values, making sure calculations and string operations only involve valid tuples and strings.

This problem integrates list processing, tuple access, lambda filtering, and character comparison to create a comprehensive task that requires understanding and combining concepts from multiple disciplines.

```python
def process_tuple_list(tuples, n):
    """
    Process a list of tuples where each tuple contains a number, a list of strings, and another number.

    Parameters:
    - tuples: List of tuples (number, list of strings, number)
    - n: Integer, used to filter tuples based on the length of the list of strings

    Returns:
    A tuple containing:
    - The tuple with the maximum first element.
    - A list of counts of strings with all identical characters from filtered tuples.
    - A list of lists containing merged strings (first and last character) from filtered tuples.
