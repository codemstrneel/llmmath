QUESTION

Write a function that takes two arrays as input. First, check if every element in the first array appears at least once in the second array, regardless of order. If this condition is met, concatenate the two arrays into a nested structure where the first array appears as a subset inside the second array, but rotated left by a number of positions equal to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the lengths of the two arrays. Finally, return this nested structure.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's revise the solution and tests to ensure correct implementation and handling of all edge cases as mentioned in the task. The main issue seems to involve accurately handling rotations and valid checks. The necessary revisions have been implemented below:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import math
from collections import Counter

def solution(arr1, arr2):
    """
    Concatenates two arrays into a nested structure where the first array appears as a subset
    inside the second array rotated to the left by the gcd of the lengths of the two arrays,
    provided every element in arr1 appears in arr2.
    
    Args:
    arr1 (list): The first array of elements.
    arr2 (list): The second array of elements.

    Returns:
    list: The nested structure combining both arrays if arr1 elements are in arr2, else None.
    """
    # Check if every element in arr1 appears in arr2 at least as many times
    count1 = Counter(arr1)
    count2 = Counter(arr2)

    for elem in count1:
        if count1[elem] > count2.get(elem, 0):
            return None

    # Calculate the rotation based on gcd of array sizes
    length1 = len(arr1)
    length2 = len(arr2)
    rotation_steps = length2 and math.gcd(length1, length2)  # Safe division

    # Rotate arr2 by the calculated steps
    rotated_arr2 = arr2[rotation_steps:] + arr2[:rotation_steps]

    # Return the nested structure
    return [arr1, rotated_arr2]
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_solution_elements_in_arr1_in_arr2():
    assert solution([1, 2], [2, 1, 3, 4]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4, 2, 1]]

def test_solution_element_not_in_arr2():
    assert solution([1, 5], [2, 1, 3, 4]) == None

def test_solution_rotation_empty_arr1():
    assert solution([], [2, 1, 3, 4]) == [[], [3, 4, 2, 1]]

def test_solution_rotation_empty_arr2():
    assert solution([1, 2], []) == None

def test_solution_identical_arrays():
    assert solution([1, 2], [1, 2]) == [[1, 2], [2, 1]]

def test_solution_non_integer_elements():
    assert solution(['a', 'b'], ['b', 'a', 'c']) == [['a', 'b'], ['a', 'c', 'b']]

def test_solution_elements_appear_more_than_once():
    assert solution([1, 1], [1, 2, 1, 3]) == [[1, 1], [2, 1, 3, 1]]

def test_solution_with_no_rotation_needed():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]) == [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]]
<|Test End|>
```

### Explanation
- The solution checks if elements from `arr1` appear in `arr2`, then calculates and applies rotation based on the GCD of the lengths.
- The test cases cover various scenarios such as:
  - Including all elements of `arr1` in `arr2`.
  - Elements of `arr1` not existing in `arr2`.
  - Handling arrays with different types and duplicate values.
  - Ensuring there's no rotation when `arr2` is empty.
   
This approach and testing should offer a comprehensive examination and validation for the task requirements.
