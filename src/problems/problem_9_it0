QUESTION

Write a function that takes a string of integers separated by spaces and returns the integer with the minimum number of set bits converted to uppercase using letters corresponding to their magnitude (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). If there are ties for the minimum, return the first such integer in the string.
