QUESTION

Write a Python function that combines basic analysis of sequences in a list of integers with simple word processing in a given string. The function should take a list of integers and a string containing words. 

The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify and return all sequences in the list of integers where consecutive numbers differ by exactly 2.

2. Count the number of words in the string.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- A list of identified sequences with a difference of 2 among consecutive integers.
- The total count of words in the string.

This problem involves recognizing simple numerical patterns and basic word counting, providing a straightforward approach to integrate both numeric and text-based analysis.

SOL & TESTS

Sure, let's start by solving the problem as described. We'll create a function named `analyze_sequence_and_text` that will handle the input list of integers and the input string, extracting sequences of numbers differing by 2 and counting the number of words in the string.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def analyze_sequence_and_text(numbers, text):
    """
    Identifies sequences where consecutive numbers differ by 2 in the list
    and counts the number of words in the text.

    Args:
    - numbers: List of integers.
    - text: String of words separated by spaces.

    Returns:
    - Tuple containing:
      - List of sequences with a difference of 2 among consecutive integers.
      - Count of words in the string.
    """
    # Identify sequences where consecutive numbers differ by exactly 2
    sequences = []
    current_sequence = []

    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] == 2:
            current_sequence.append(numbers[i])
            if i == len(numbers) - 2:  # Include last number if sequence continues till end
                current_sequence.append(numbers[i + 1])
        else:
            if current_sequence:
                current_sequence.append(numbers[i])
                sequences.append(current_sequence)
                current_sequence = []
    if current_sequence:
        sequences.append(current_sequence)

    # Count the number of words in the text
    word_count = len(text.split())

    return sequences, word_count
<|Solution End|>
```

Now, let's write the unit tests for this function using pytest style.

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import analyze_sequence_and_text

def test_analyze_sequence_and_text_basic():
    result = analyze_sequence_and_text([1, 3, 5, 7, 6], "hello world")
    assert result == ([[1, 3, 5, 7]], 2)  # Sequence (1, 3, 5, 7) with 2 words

def test_analyze_sequence_and_text_no_sequence():
    result = analyze_sequence_and_text([1, 2, 4, 7], "one two")
    assert result == ([], 2)  # No sequence differing by 2 consecutively

def test_analyze_sequence_and_text_single_word():
    result = analyze_sequence_and_text([10, 12, 14, 17, 19], "loneword")
    assert result == ([[10, 12, 14]], 1)  # Sequence (10, 12, 14) with 1 word

def test_analyze_sequence_and_text_multiple_sequences():
    result = analyze_sequence_and_text([10, 12, 14, 20, 22, 24, 1, 3, 5], "this is a test string")
    assert result == ([[10, 12, 14], [20, 22, 24], [1, 3, 5]], 5)  # Multiple sequences and 5 words

def test_analyze_sequence_and_text_empty_input():
    result = analyze_sequence_and_text([], "")
    assert result == ([], 0)  # No sequence and no words

def test_analyze_sequence_and_text_single_number():
    result = analyze_sequence_and_text([1], "single")
    assert result == ([], 1)  # Single number, cannot form sequence, 1 word
<|Test End|>
```

These tests cover various scenarios such as basic input, no sequences with a difference of 2, single numbers or words, and multiple sequences.
