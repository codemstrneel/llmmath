QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of tuples and a dictionary as input. The list of tuples should be chunked into sublists, each containing a maximum of n tuples, such that the sum of the integers in each tuple does not exceed a threshold t. Simultaneously, convert each key in the dictionary from camel case to snake case using a regular expression and replace the associated values with a list where each element is repeated n times using the map function. Return the modified list of sublists and the transformed dictionary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues found during the code execution. The primary problems are related to the solution logic which incorrectly created chunks for certain test cases where the tuple sum exceeded the given threshold `t`. We need to ensure that the tuples are properly grouped such that no group's sum exceeds the threshold, even if this results in some groups having fewer than `n` tuples. Let's adjust the solution and ensure the test cases are appropriately aligned to test the correct logic.

Also, in some failed test cases, the expected behavior of the function is incorrect. Let's fix the logic, especially the chunking part, and adjust the tests to correctly reflect the intended functionality.

These modifications should now correctly handle the logic for both part of the task: chunking tuples based on the sum and limit, and transforming the dictionary as described.
