QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a tuple consisting of integers and a string as input. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Calculate the product of all the numbers in the tuple.
2. Reverse the sequence of bits in the product, except for the first and last two bits, which should remain unchanged.
3. Remove all words of a specific length \( k \) from the given string, where \( k \) is the number of 1s in the bit-reversed value from step 2.

Return the final modified string as output.
