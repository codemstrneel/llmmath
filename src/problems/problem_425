QUESTION

Here's a novel coding question inspired by combining multiple elements from the provided questions:

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes in three arguments: a list of strings, a list of numbers, and a set of integer thresholds for primes and consecutive frequency (a tuple of two positive integers). The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Remove duplicate words from the list of strings, preserving the order of their first occurrence.
2. Identify prime numbers in the list of numbers.
3. Count the frequency of each prime number, considering each group of consecutive occurrences as a single instance (e.g., [3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 3, 3] would have prime groups [3, 5, 7, 3]).
4. Construct a dictionary where each key is a prime number with consecutive duplicates from the list, and each value is a sub-dictionary containing:
   - "consec_count": the number of consecutive groups for this prime.
   - "consec_exceeds_threshold": a boolean indicating whether "consec_count" meets or exceeds the consecutive frequency threshold given.
5. Only include in the final dictionary those prime numbers where their count of consecutive groups meets or exceeds the prime threshold specified as the first value in the input tuple threshold.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- The processed list of strings without duplicates.
- The constructed dictionary for the prime number analysis filtered by the provided thresholds.

**Example:**

```python
def process_data(strings, numbers, thresholds):
    pass

strings = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana", "date"]
numbers = [2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 2, 2, 11, 11, 11, 11]
thresholds = (2, 2)

result = process_data(strings, numbers, thresholds)

# Expected Output:
# (['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'],
#  {
#    3: {"consec_count": 1, "consec_exceeds_threshold": False},
#    5: {"consec_count": 1, "consec_exceeds_threshold": False},
#    11: {"consec_count": 1, "consec_exceeds_threshold": False}
#  })
```

In this question, we combine concepts of string processing, prime identification, and frequency analysis using consecutive occurrence logic, tying together ideas from Questions 1, 2, 4, and 5 into a novel challenge.
