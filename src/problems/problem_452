QUESTION

Certainly! Let's create a new question that combines core concepts from the provided questions focusing on string processing, frequency counting, and handling lists. Here's a novel question that integrates these elements:

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes in a list of strings and a list of numbers, performing the following tasks:

1. Remove duplicate words from the list of strings while preserving the order of their first occurrences.
2. Calculate the sum of the lengths of strings that are palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and have positive length. Use a lambda function to assist with this calculation.
3. Determine the smallest missing positive integer derived from the lengths of these palindrome strings.
4. Analyze the list of numbers and count the frequency of each number, but consider consecutive occurrences of the same number as a single occurrence. Return a dictionary representing the frequency count of these distinct consecutive numbers.

The function should return a tuple with four elements:

- The list of strings with duplicates removed.
- The sum of the lengths of the palindrome strings.
- The smallest missing positive integer based on the lengths of palindrome strings.
- A dictionary representing the frequency count of the distinct consecutive numbers.

Ensure the function handles scenarios where the string list or number list may be empty, and consider only strings with characters for palindrome checking.

SOL & TESTS

```python
def process_lists(strings, numbers):
    def is_palindrome(s):
        return s == s[::-1]

    # Remove duplicates from strings while preserving order.
    seen = set()
    strings_no_duplicates = []
    for word in strings:
        if word not in seen:
            strings_no_duplicates.append(word)
            seen.add(word)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the lengths of palindrome strings.
    palindrome_lengths = list(map(lambda s: len(s), filter(lambda s: is_palindrome(s) and len(s) > 0, strings_no_duplicates)))
    sum_palindrome_lengths = sum(palindrome_lengths)

    # Find the smallest missing positive integer from the lengths of palindrome strings.
    smallest_missing_positive = 1
    palindrome_lengths_set = set(palindrome_lengths)
    while smallest_missing_positive in palindrome_lengths_set:
        smallest_missing_positive += 1

    # Count the frequency of distinct consecutive numbers.
    if not numbers:
        number_frequencies = {}
    else:
        number_frequencies = {}
        previous_num = None
        for num in numbers:
            if num != previous_num:
                if num not in number_frequencies:
                    number_frequencies[num] = 0
                number_frequencies[num] += 1
            previous_num = num

    return (strings_no_duplicates, sum_palindrome_lengths, smallest_missing_positive, number_frequencies)
