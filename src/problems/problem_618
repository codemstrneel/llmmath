QUESTION

Here is a new novel question that combines concepts from Question 1 and Question 3, focusing on matrix processing, tuple manipulation, string computations, and conditions around sums of squares:

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that processes a matrix of tuples, where each tuple contains a set of integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Remove duplicate rows, where two rows are considered duplicates if their sets of integers are equivalent.

2. For each unique row, perform the following:
    - Calculate the sum of all integers in the row.
    - Determine if this sum can be represented as the sum of squares of two distinct non-negative integers (ensure that neither integer equals the square root of the sum).
  
3. If the condition is met, take the sum of the integers, convert it into a string, and extract the first three continuous characters from the string. If there are fewer than three characters, extract all available characters.

4. If the condition about representing the sum as a sum of squares is not met, omit that row from the results.

5. Return a list of extracted strings for those rows meeting the condition.

### Example:

Given the following matrix:

```python
[
    [(1, 2, 3)], 
    [(4, 5)], 
    [(3, 3, 2)], 
    [(0, 6)]
]
```

After removing duplicates and calculating the sum of each row, suppose the sums are `6`, `9`, `8`, and `6`.

Applying the sums-of-squares condition (e.g., `5 + 1 = 6`, `3 + 3 = 9`, `4 + 4 = 8`) should yield valid sequences for all sums except row one (since `6` does not satisfy distinct non-zero square conditions).

The result might look like:

```python
["9", "8"]
```

This captures the essence of managing duplicates, processing mathematical properties of integers, and string manipulations based on arithmetic conditions.
