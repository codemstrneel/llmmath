QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of tuples, interchanges the first and last element of each tuple, and then removes any resulting tuples that are empty or contain only zeros.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there was an attempt to output formatted as a code block in the solution, which led to a compilation error. Let's correct that and also ensure our unit tests properly verify the function's behavior.

Here's how we can refine this:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(tuples_list):
    """
    Interchanges the first and last elements of each tuple in the list.
    Removes tuples that are empty or contain only zeros after the interchange.
    """
    result = []
    for t in tuples_list:
        if len(t) > 1:
            swapped = (t[-1],) + t[1:-1] + (t[0],)
        elif len(t) == 1:
            swapped = (t[0],)
        else:
            swapped = ()
        
        # Remove tuple if it's empty or contains only zeros
        if swapped and any(element != 0 for element in swapped):
            result.append(swapped)
    
    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_interchange_and_remove_empty_or_zero_only_tuples():
    assert solution([(1, 2, 3), (4, 0), (0,)]) == [(3, 2, 1), (0, 4)]
    assert solution([(0, 0), (0, 0, 0), (5, 6, 0)]) == [(0, 6, 5)]
    assert solution([(), (0,), (0, 0)]) == []
    assert solution([(1,), (2, 3), (0, 1, 0)]) == [(1,), (3, 2), (0, 1)]
    assert solution([(9, 8, 0), (1, 0, 1)]) == [(0, 8, 9), (1, 0, 1)]

def test_single_element_tuples():
    assert solution([(0,), (5,)]) == [(5,)]
    assert solution([(0, 0, 0), (9,)]) == [(9,)]
    assert solution([(10,), (0, 0), ()]) == [(10,)]
    assert solution([(0,)]) == []

def test_no_change_needed():
    assert solution([(1, 0), (0, 3)]) == [(0, 1), (3, 0)]
    assert solution([(1, 2, 3), (3, 2, 1)]) == [(3, 2, 1), (1, 2, 3)]

def test_empty_input():
    assert solution([]) == []

def test_all_zero_tuples():
    assert solution([(0, 0, 0, 0), (0,)]) == []
```
<|Test End|>

This corrected version should compile and run successfully. The solution function is encapsulated properly without additional formatting syntax errors, and the test cases are aimed at various edge cases concerning tuple interchanges and clean-ups.
