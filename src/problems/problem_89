QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a string, a non-negative integer n, and a list of lists as inputs. First, separate words in the string that begin with capital letters by inserting spaces using regular expressions. Count the separated words and determine if this count is odd or even. 

If the count is even, determine the number of rotations required to sort the list of lists based on the nth column, and then calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Return both the number of rotations and the Fibonacci number as a tuple. 

If the count is odd, check if the nth column of the list of lists can be transformed into a list where all elements are isomorphic strings (where two strings have bijections between their characters). If this is possible, return the column as a sorted list using heap sort; if not, return an empty list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step by step. Here's a concise breakdown before we dive into implementation:

1. **Separate Words in String:** We'll use a regular expression to insert spaces before capital letters in a given string and count these words.
  
2. **Check Count Odd or Even:** 
   - If even, we sort the list of lists based on the specified nth column, determine the number of rotations for it to be sorted, and compute the nth Fibonacci number.
   - If odd, check for isomorphic strings in the nth column and return a sorted list of that column if possible.

3. **Fibonacci Function and Sorting:** 
   - We'll implement a simple Fibonacci function.
   - We'll use a function to perform heap sort to sort the given column or any list provided.

Now letâ€™s get started with the code implementation.
