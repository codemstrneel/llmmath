QUESTION

Write a function that takes as input a list and a tuple of keys. The function should add the tuple to the list, then calculate the frequency of each element in the resulting list. Finally, return the elements with the two highest frequencies in descending order of their frequency. If there is a tie, order the elements themselves in ascending order.
