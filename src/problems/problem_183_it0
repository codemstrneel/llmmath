QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of integers representing coin denominations and a target integer. The function should return the maximum product of any three distinct denominations that can be used to sum up to the target value. If it is not possible to find such a combination, the function should return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The problem requires finding three distinct coin denominations whose sum equals a target value, and then calculating the maximum product of those three denominations. If such a combination does not exist, it returns -1. Let's implement this logic in the function and provide unit tests as specified.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(denominations, target):
    n = len(denominations)
    denominations.sort()
    max_product = -1
    
    # Iterate over all triplet combinations
    for i in range(n-2):
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            for k in range(j+1, n):
                if denominations[i] + denominations[j] + denominations[k] == target:
                    product = denominations[i] * denominations[j] * denominations[k]
                    max_product = max(max_product, product)
    
    return max_product
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_example_case():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 9) == 60

def test_no_combination():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4], 15) == -1

def test_all_negative_numbers():
    assert solution([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], -6) == -6

def test_including_zero():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == 0

def test_repeat_numbers():
    assert solution([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3], 6) == 12

def test_large_numbers():
    assert solution([100, 200, 300, 400, 500], 1000) == 30000000

def test_duplicated_combination_max():
    # Maximum product when selecting carefully
    assert solution([5, 5, 5, 10, 15, 3, 35, 20], 50) == 10500
    
def test_exact_sum_not_minimum_combination():
    assert solution([1, 2, 8, 10, 20, 30], 38) == 4800
<|Test End|>
```
This code systematically tries out different triplet combinations of coin denominations to achieve the target value with the maximum possible product. The test cases cover different scenarios, including ones where such combinations don't exist, ones requiring the optimal choice for the maximum product, and others considering negative and zero values.
