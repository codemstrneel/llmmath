QUESTION

Create a Python function that takes a list of strings representing integer tuples and a target integer as input. This function should perform two tasks: 

1. Convert each string in the list to its corresponding integer tuple and sort these tuples in increasing order based on the last element of each tuple.

2. After sorting, identify the position of the tuple containing the target integer in its first position. If the target integer is not found, return -1. If multiple tuples have the target integer in the first position, return the first occurrence's position.

For example:
```python
def process_and_search_tuples(tuple_strings, target):
    # Your implementation here

tuples_list = ["(3, 4)", "(1, 2)", "(5, 0)", "(8, 6)"]
target = 5
print(process_and_search_tuples(tuples_list, target))
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

In this example, the list of tuples after conversion and sorting based on the last element is: [(5, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4), (8, 6)]. The tuple (5, 0) is at index 2, based on 0-based indexing.
