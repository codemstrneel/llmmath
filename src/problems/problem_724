QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of strings representing decimal numbers and a single string representing binary data. The function should perform the following sequence of operations:

1. **Filter Valid Numbers:**
   Use a lambda function to filter out only the strings that can be successfully converted to integer values from the list of decimal number strings.

2. **Combine and Convert:**
   Convert the filtered list of valid decimal number strings into integers. Also, convert the input binary string into an integer.

3. **Bitwise Operations:**
   Find and return the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of each integer from the combined step. If there are no set bits, indicate this in the result. Simultaneously, calculate the sum of the squares of these integers.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   Return a formatted string using an f-string or similar method. The string should describe the list of original strings that could be converted into integers, the binary integer, the list of rightmost set bit positions, the filtered list of squares, and their sum.

This question blends elements of lambda filtering from Question 1, bit manipulation from Question 2, arithmetic series manipulation from Question 3, and formatted output from Question 1. It presents a novel challenge demanding proficiency in data conversion, bit manipulation, and formatted output.
