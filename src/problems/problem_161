QUESTION

Design a function that determines the maximum number of distinct tiles measuring x, y, and z units in length that can be used to exactly cover a floor of length m units without breaking any tiles.

SOL & TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct tile lengths that can perfectly fill a given floor length. The key to solving this problem is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the tile lengths and the floor length. This is because the floor can be perfectly tiled using the given tile lengths only if their GCD divides the floor length. Hereâ€™s how this can be implemented:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def max_distinct_tiles(m, x, y, z):
    """
    Returns the number of distinct tile lengths that can be used to exactly
    cover a floor of length `m` without breaking any tiles.
    
    Parameters:
    - m: length of the floor
    - x, y, z: lengths of the distinct tiles
    
    Returns:
    - Integer: the maximum number of distinct tile lengths that can be used
    """

    # Find GCD of each tile length with the floor length
    from math import gcd

    def is_coverable(length):
        return m % length == 0

    possible_tiles = [x, y, z]
    distinct_coverable = sum(is_coverable(tile) for tile in possible_tiles)
    
    return distinct_coverable
```
<|Solution End|>

```python
<|Test Begin|>
def test_max_distinct_tiles_basic():
    # Test case with floor length of 6, and tile lengths 2, 3, 4
    assert max_distinct_tiles(6, 2, 3, 4) == 2  # 2 and 3 can fill the floor

def test_max_distinct_tiles_with_no_possible_tiles():
    # Test case where no single tile can exactly fill the length
    assert max_distinct_tiles(7, 2, 3, 4) == 0  # None of them can fill 7

def test_max_distinct_tiles_all_fit():
    # Test case where all tile lengths perfectly divide the floor
    assert max_distinct_tiles(12, 2, 3, 4) == 3  # All tiles can fill the floor

def test_max_distinct_tiles_single_tile_fit():
    # Test case with only one tile length fitting the floor
    assert max_distinct_tiles(10, 2, 3, 5) == 1  # Only 5 can fill the floor
  
def test_max_distinct_tiles_repeated_lengths():
    # Test case with repeated tile lengths
    assert max_distinct_tiles(24, 8, 8, 8) == 1  # Only 8 can fill the floor
