QUESTION

Here's a novel coding question that combines core concepts from the provided questions:

**New Combined Question:**

Write a Python function that processes a complex data structure composed of both string manipulation and numeric operations followed by verification tasks.

1. **Input Structures**:
   - A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a "type" (a string) and "data" (a list of integers).
   - A specially formatted string indicating a series of operations such as "Scale5Twist15Flip3.5".

2. **Requirements**:
   - **Dictionary Processing**:
     - Merge all the "data" lists from the dictionaries.
     - For each number in the merged list, determine if it is both at an even index and a perfect square.
     - Calculate the sum of all numbers that meet these criteria.
   - **String Parsing and Numeric Validation**:
     - Parse the string to extract operations and their numerical values, distinguishing between different operations such as "Scale", "Twist", "Flip".
     - Validate if all the extracted numerical values are integers. If not, ignore the non-integer values.
     - Compute the sum of the remaining valid numerical values.
   - **Verification**:
     - Perform a modulo operation across all the integers from the parsed string based on their privilege operations (e.g., "mod Scale", "mod Twist") with a common divisor extracted from a given list of prime numbers. Compare results to ensure they match a pattern that establishes a cycle, akin to forming geometric symmetry (like a fractal or tessellation).
     - If the geometry is validated as symmetric, allow those operations; otherwise, reject them.

3. **Output**:
   - Return a dictionary containing:
     - The sum of the perfect square numbers at even indices from the dictionary data.
     - The sum of validated integer values derived from the parsed string.
     - A Boolean indicating symmetry validation of the operations from the string based on their modulo results.

This question integrates aspects of manipulative string operations, number characteristic identification, pattern recognition, and modular arithmetic validation, offering a deeper challenge than the original questions.
