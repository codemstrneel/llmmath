QUESTION

Write a function that determines if one array (array A) can be transformed into a permutation of a subset of another array (array B), such that the subset elements in array B appear in the same relative order as they do in array A. If this condition is met, return the starting index of this subset in array B. Additionally, return the count of unique elements from this subset that also appear in array A. If the condition is not met, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the syntax error by ensuring we remove the outermost triple quotes that were inappropriately included in the solution and test code cells. I'll also re-examine the solution and make sure it fulfills the requirement for the problem as described: 

1. The function should verify that the elements of array A appear in array B in the same relative order, and can form a subset of B.
2. We will adjust the logic to correctly determine if A can be found as an ordered subset within B and then determine the position and unique element count.

Here's the corrected solution and test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(array_a, array_b):
    """
    Determines if array_a can be a subsequence of any subset of array_b.
    Return the starting index of this subset in array_b and the count of unique
    elements from this subset that also appear in array_a. Returns -1 if no valid
    sequence is found.
    """
    len_a = len(array_a)
    len_b = len(array_b)
    
    # Edge cases
    if len_a == 0 or len_b < len_a:
        return -1
    
    # Traverse array_b and try to match array_a in the correct order
    for start in range(len_b - len_a + 1):
        subset_b = array_b[start:start + len_a]
        
        if subset_b == array_a:
            unique_count = len(set(subset_b) & set(array_a))
            return start, unique_count
    
    return -1
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_exact_sequence_match():
    # Exact match is present
    assert solution([1, 2], [3, 1, 2, 4]) == (1, 2)

def test_solution_sequence_at_different_index():
    # The correct sequence is in the latter part
    assert solution([1, 2], [3, 4, 1, 2, 5]) == (2, 2)

def test_solution_no_order_match():
    # No correct order of sequence match
    assert solution([2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == -1

def test_solution_complete_match():
    # Array A and B are identical
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) == (0, 3)

def test_solution_no_valid_sequence():
    # B is shorter than A
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 3]) == -1

def test_solution_empty_array_a():
    # Array A is empty
    assert solution([], [1, 2, 3]) == -1

def test_solution_single_element_match():
    # Single element from array_a present in array_b as full sequence
    assert solution([2], [3, 2, 4]) == (1, 1)

def test_solution_no_single_element_match():
    # Single element not present
    assert solution([5], [1, 2, 3]) == -1
<|Test End|>
```

This corrected version should align more closely with the requirements of the problem statement. The solution function now checks if `array_a` can be part of any subsequence in `array_b`â€”ensuring that ordering in `array_a` is respected and the test cases reflect possible scenarios efficiently.
