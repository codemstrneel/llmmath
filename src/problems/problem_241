QUESTION

**Combined Novel Question:**

Write a Python function that integrates elements of list processing, numeric calculations, and tuple filtering. The function should accept two inputs: a list of strings and a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a string and three integers. The task is as follows:

1. Remove any strings from the list that contain numbers.
2. For each tuple, sum the three integer values, and if the sum is a prime number, retain that tuple; otherwise, exclude it.
3. For the remaining tuples, group them by the initial character of the contained string (case insensitive).
4. Within each group, calculate the average of the sums of the integers for that group.
5. Return a dictionary where the keys are the starting letters (in lowercase) of the grouped strings, and the values are the calculated averages for each group.

For example, given the input list of strings `["apple", "banana42", "cherry", "42date"]` and the list of tuples `[("apple", 2, 4, 6), ("apricot", 7, 11, 13), ("banana", 5, 7, 10), ("cherry", 3, 5, 7)]`, the output should be:

```python
{
    'a': 31,
    'c': 15
}
```

In this example:
- The string list is filtered to remove "banana42" and "42date", leaving ["apple", "cherry"].
- The tuple ("banana", 5, 7, 10) is removed because the sum 22 is not prime.
- The tuple sums for "apple" and "apricot" with prime-check are 12 and 31 respectively, grouped under 'a'.
- Only ("cherry", 3, 5, 7) with a sum of 15 (prime) remains, grouped under 'c'.
- Thus, the output dictionary contains the group averages: {'a': 31, 'c': 15}.
