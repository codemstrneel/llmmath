QUESTION

Write a function that determines if one array (array A) can be transformed into a permutation of a subset of another array (array B), such that the subset elements in array B appear in the same relative order as they do in array A. If this condition is met, return the starting index of this subset in array B. Additionally, return the count of unique elements from this subset that also appear in array A. If the condition is not met, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Certainly! Let's tackle this problem by implementing the solution function according to the given requirements and then write the unit tests.

The function will perform the following:
1. Check if `array A` can be a subsequence and permutation of any subset of `array B`.
2. Return the starting index of this subset in `array B` and the count of unique elements from this subset that also appear in `array A`.
3. If the condition is not met, return -1.

Given these requirements, the solution will be implemented and the tests will follow to validate it:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(array_a, array_b):
    """
    Determines if array_a can be transformed into a permutation of a subset of array_b
    such that array_b subset elements appear in array_a's order. If valid, returns the starting
    index of this subset in array_b and the count of unique elements from this subset that
    also appear in array_a. If not valid, returns -1.
    """
    len_a = len(array_a)
    len_b = len(array_b)
    
    # Edge cases
    if len_a == 0:
        return -1  # Empty array_a cannot provide a valid start index.
    
    if len_b < len_a:
        return -1  # array_b is smaller than array_a, can't be permutation of subset.
    
    # Attempt to find if array_a can be a permutation of any subset of array_b
    for start in range(len_b - len_a + 1):
        # Extract a possible matching subset from array_b
        subset_b = array_b[start:start + len_a]
        
        # Check if the elements can be a permutation of array_a
        if sorted(subset_b) == sorted(array_a):
            # Count unique elements in the subset that also appear in array_a
            unique_count = len(set(subset_b) & set(array_a))
            return start, unique_count
    
    return -1  # No valid permutation found
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_permutation_present():
    # basic test with permutation present
    assert solution([3, 1], [5, 3, 1, 2]) == (1, 2)

def test_solution_permutation_starting_at_different_index():
    # permutation is at a latter position
    assert solution([1, 2], [3, 4, 1, 2, 5]) == (2, 2)

def test_solution_no_permutation():
    # there's no matching permutation
    assert solution([4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]) == -1

def test_solution_exact_match():
    # Test where array_a is exactly array_b
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) == (0, 3)

def test_solution_subset_with_duplicates():
    # Test where array_b has more elements but still can match array_a
    assert solution([1, 2], [1, 2, 2, 1, 3]) == (0, 2)

def test_solution_no_possible_subset():
    # Arrange a test where len(array_b) < len(array_a)
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]) == -1

def test_solution_empty_array_a():
    # Test with empty array_a
    assert solution([], [1, 2, 3]) == -1

def test_solution_single_element_match():
    # Test with a single element where match is present
    assert solution([2], [3, 2, 4, 5]) == (1, 1)

def test_solution_single_element_no_match():
    # Test with a single element where no match is present
    assert solution([8], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == -1
<|Test End|>
```

These tests will help ensure the function works properly across various edge cases and typical scenarios.
