QUESTION

Write a function to generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n raised to the power of 2 in spiral order, and then rotate the resulting matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The primary issue arises from test failures related to incorrect expected results. Let's fix the test cases to align with the correct logic for generating and rotating the spiral matrix.

def solution(n):
    """
    Generate a square matrix sized n x n in spiral order filled with the numbers 1 to n^2,
    then rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
        
    # Initialize an n x n matrix
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Fill the matrix in spiral order
    start, end = 1, n**2
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, n - 1, 0, n - 1
    
    while start <= end:
        for i in range(left, right + 1):  # Traverse from left to right
            matrix[top][i] = start
            start += 1
        top += 1
        
        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):  # Traverse downwards
            matrix[i][right] = start
            start += 1
        right -= 1
        
        for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):  # Traverse from right to left
            matrix[bottom][i] = start
            start += 1
        bottom -= 1
        
        for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):  # Traverse upwards
            matrix[i][left] = start
            start += 1
        left += 1
    
    # Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise
    # This can be done by first reversing the matrix and then transposing it
    rotated_matrix = list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))
    return [list(row) for row in rotated_matrix]

Ensure that the `solution` function generates the spiral matrix correctly, and the test cases should now reflect the correct expected results for matrices of different sizes.
