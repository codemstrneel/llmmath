QUESTION

Implement a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer n, and returns a new list where each tuple is repeated n times. Additionally, each element of the tuples should be replaced with the modulo of that element using a given modulus value.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issue with the original solution is that it tries to multiply a generator comprehension directly with an integer, which is not a valid operation. We need to convert the generator expression to a tuple first before multiplying it. Below is the corrected solution and its corresponding unit tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(lst, n, modulus):
    """
    Takes a list of tuples and an integer n, repeats each tuple n times, and replaces 
    each element of the tuples with the modulo of that element using the given modulus.

    Parameters:
    - lst: List[Tuple[int]]  -> List of tuples containing integers.
    - n: int                 -> Number of times each tuple should be repeated.
    - modulus: int           -> The modulus value to apply to each element.

    Returns:
    - List[Tuple[int]]       -> New list with each tuple repeated n times and elements replaced by their modulus.
    """
    return [tuple(element % modulus for element in tpl) for tpl in lst for _ in range(n)]
