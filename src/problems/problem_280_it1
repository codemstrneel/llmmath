QUESTION

Write a Python function to evaluate the discriminant of a quadratic equation.

SOLUTION/TESTS

I understand the need to address the compilation error due to an incorrectly formatted Python code block. Let's fix that by correctly formatting the code and ensuring everything is correct.

The issue appears to be with the use of triple quotes and the language syntax within the code block tags. I will adjust it to a valid format by removing the unnecessary use of triple quotes for the Python code block within the solution and the tests.

Let's rectify that:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(a, b, c):
    """
    Evaluates the discriminant of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
    
    Parameters:
    a (float): The coefficient of x^2.
    b (float): The coefficient of x.
    c (float): The constant term.
    
    Returns:
    float: The discriminant of the quadratic equation.
    """
    return b**2 - 4*a*c
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_discriminant_positive():
    # Test where the discriminant is positive, meaning two distinct real roots
    assert solution(1, -3, 2) == 1  # D = (-3)^2 - 4*1*2 = 9 - 8 = 1

def test_discriminant_zero():
    # Test where the discriminant is zero, meaning two equal real roots
    assert solution(1, 2, 1) == 0  # D = 2^2 - 4*1*1 = 4 - 4 = 0

def test_discriminant_negative():
    # Test where the discriminant is negative, meaning two complex roots
    assert solution(1, 0, 1) == -4  # D = 0^2 - 4*1*1 = -4

def test_discriminant_large_coefficients():
    # Test with large coefficients
    assert solution(1000, 5000, 2000) == (5000**2 - 4*1000*2000)  # Calculating manually

def test_discriminant_zero_coefficients():
    # Test with zero coefficients resulting in any form
    assert solution(0, 2, 1) == 4  # D = 2^2 = 4 when a=0, it's not a quadratic but we test the discriminant anyway
    assert solution(1, 0, 0) == 0  # D = 0^2 - 4*1*0 = 0
```
<|Test End|>

Now the code should be correctly formatted and able to execute correctly with the test framework.
