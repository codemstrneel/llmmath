QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of strings, a list of tuples (each containing two integers), and a single string s. The function should:

1. Use a lambda function to filter out strings from the list that contain any of the characters from string s or have a length that is equal to any of the elements in any tuple from the list of tuples.
2. Construct a list from these filtered strings where each element is a tuple containing the index, the original string, and the length of the corresponding string.
3. Return a list of tuples where each tuple includes:
   - The concatenated result of the original strings from step 2.
   - The most common character(s) across all strings or an indicator if no common character is found.
   - The even parity (True if even, False if odd) of the count of tuples from step 2.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears that there was an issue with the code formatting within the solution and test sections. Let's fix the solution and test format properly so they can be executed successfully. Additionally, we'll ensure the implementation matches the expected behavior.

### Corrected and Reformatted Solution and Tests

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
from collections import Counter

def solution(strings, tuples, s):
    # Step 1: Filtering
    def is_valid(string):
        if any(char in s for char in string):  # If string has any char from s, it's invalid
            return False
        if any(len(string) == length for t in tuples for length in t):  # If length matches any in tuples
            return False
        return True
    
    # Get filtered strings with their index and length
    filtered_strings_with_index = [(i, string, len(string)) 
                                   for i, string in enumerate(strings) 
                                   if is_valid(string)]
    
    # Step 2: Construct final tuples
    if not filtered_strings_with_index:
        return []

    # Concatenate strings
    concatenated = ''.join(original for idx, original, length in filtered_strings_with_index)

    # Determine common characters
    char_count = Counter(concatenated)
    if char_count:
        most_common_freq = max(char_count.values())
        most_common_chars = [char for char, freq in char_count.items() if freq == most_common_freq]
    else:
        most_common_chars = []

    # Check even parity (True if even, False if odd)
    is_even = len(filtered_strings_with_index) % 2 == 0

    return [(concatenated, most_common_chars, is_even)]
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_no_valid_strings():
    assert solution([], [(3, 4)], "abc") == []

def test_solution_all_filtered_out():
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "pear"], [(5,)], "a") == []

def test_solution_partial_filtering():
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "pear"], [(5,)], "x") == [('pear', ['r', 'e'], False)]

def test_solution_all_pass_filter():
    assert solution(["goodbye", "night"], [(1, 9)], "x") == [('goodbyenight', ['g', 'o'], True)]

def test_solution_empty_string_input_s():
    assert solution(["hello", "world", "test"], [], "") == [('helloworldtest', ['l'], True)]

def test_solution_special_characters():
    assert solution(["123", "!@#", "abc", "de"], [(1, 2)], "xyz") == [('123!@#', ['1', '2', '3', '!'], True)]

def test_solution_multiple_most_common():
    # The characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' all appear twice in the result
    assert solution(["aabb", "ccdd"], [], "xyz") == [('aabbccdd', ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], True)]
```
<|Test End|>

This reformatting ensures that code blocks are properly handled, ensuring that there are no syntax issues when executing the code. The solution implements string filtering and evaluation based on the given specifications, and the tests comprehensively assess different scenarios for accuracy.
