QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes in the following two arguments:
1. A list of strings.
2. A list of floating-point numbers.

The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Remove duplicate words from the list of strings, preserving the order of their first occurrences. Identify all unique words that are most frequently followed by another word starting with a vowel. 
2. From the list of floating-point numbers, create a new list where each positive number is transformed into a tuple. Each tuple should have two elements: the frequency of the number in the list and the number rounded to one decimal place. Use a lambda function to filter for positive numbers only.
3. Calculate the total number of vowels in the concatenated string formed by joining the unique words from the deduplicated list.
4. Count the frequency of numbers in the original floating-point list, where each consecutive occurrence of the same number is considered as one block. Prime numbers should be excluded from this frequency count.

The function should return a tuple with four elements:

- A list of unique words that are most frequently followed by a word starting with a vowel.
- A list of tuples representing the positive floating-point numbers with their frequency and rounded value.
- The total count of vowels in the concatenated unique string list.
- A dictionary representing the frequency count of non-prime numbers, based on consecutive occurrence blocks in the floating-point list.
