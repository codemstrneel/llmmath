QUESTION

Write a function to rotate a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction, and then return the sum of the elements in the list that are prime numbers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues encountered in the unit tests and ensure that our tests cover the necessary cases. The main problem in the initial tests is an edge case where an empty list is supplied, leading to a "modulo by zero" error in the rotation logic. Let's update the solution and unit tests accordingly.

We'll handle the empty list case in both the solution and the unit tests to ensure they are robust.

Firstly, we'll update the solution to handle an empty list. Then, we'll adjust the tests to reflect a logical use case.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(lst, n):
    """
    Rotates the list `lst` by `n` positions to the right and returns the sum of the prime numbers in the rotated list.
    """
    def is_prime(num):
        """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        if num <= 3:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= num:
            if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    # Handle empty list
    if not lst:
        return 0

    # Rotate the list
    n = n % len(lst)  # To handle n greater than the length of the list
    rotated_lst = lst[-n:] + lst[:-n]
    
    # Sum the prime numbers
    prime_sum = sum(x for x in rotated_lst if is_prime(x))
    return prime_sum
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_no_rotation():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0) == 10  # Corrected expected sum of primes: 2, 3, 5

def test_full_rotation():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) == 10  # Full rotation, same list, sum of primes: 2, 3, 5

def test_partial_rotation():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == 10  # Rotated: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], sum of primes: 2, 3, 5

def test_rotation_with_non_prime_sum():
    assert solution([4, 6, 8, 9], 1) == 0  # Rotated: [9, 4, 6, 8], no primes

def test_rotation_with_mixed_numbers():
    assert solution([17, 2, 31, 8], 3) == 50  # Rotated: [2, 31, 8, 17], sum of primes: 17, 31, 2

def test_large_numbers():
    assert solution([101, 103, 107, 109, 113], 10) == 533  # 101, 103, 107, 109, 113 are all primes

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 4) == 0  # Empty list

def test_single_element_prime():
    assert solution([3], 1) == 3  # Single prime element

def test_single_element_non_prime():
    assert solution([4], 1) == 0  # Single non-prime element
<|Test End|>

This revised solution and unit tests should now pass successfully and account properly for scenarios such as an empty list, rotations, and primes detection.
