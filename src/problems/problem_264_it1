QUESTION

Write a Python function that determines if it's possible to form a triangle with a positive area using three given angles, and if so, returns the number formed by left rotating the bits of the largest angle.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issue appears to be a formatting problem with the inclusion of triple backticks (```) in the solution section. Let's remove them and also ensure that the bit rotation logic functions correctly. I'll correct the solution and revise the tests accordingly.

Here is the corrected code and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(angle1, angle2, angle3):
    """
    Determines if a triangle can be formed with the given angles.
    If yes, returns an integer formed by left rotating the bits of the largest angle.
    A triangle is valid if the sum of angles is 180 degrees and none are zero.
    """
    # Check if the angles can form a triangle
    if any(angle <= 0 for angle in (angle1, angle2, angle3)) or (angle1 + angle2 + angle3 != 180):
        raise ValueError("The angles do not form a valid triangle.")
    
    # Identify the largest angle
    largest_angle = max(angle1, angle2, angle3)
    
    # Rotate bits to the left of the largest angle
    numbers_of_bits = largest_angle.bit_length()  # Determine how many bits we need to consider
    if numbers_of_bits == 0:
        return 0
    rotated = (largest_angle << 1) & ((1 << numbers_of_bits) - 1)  # Keep this within the bit length
    if largest_angle & (1 << (numbers_of_bits - 1)):  # if the highest bit of the original number was set
        rotated |= 1  # set the least significant bit
    
    return rotated
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_triangle_formed_valid_angles():
    assert solution(60, 60, 60) == 120  # 60 in binary is 111100, rotated left is 1111000 which is 120

def test_triangle_formed_largest_angle():
    assert solution(90, 45, 45) == 0  # 90 in binary is 1011010, rotated and masked by bit length gives 0

def test_triangle_formed_large_angles():
    assert solution(100, 40, 40) == 37  # 100 in binary is 1100100, rotated left is 100101 then cut to bit length 37

def test_invalid_triangle_angles():
    try:
        solution(90, 90, 10)
        assert False, "Expected ValueError"
    except ValueError as e:
        assert str(e) == "The angles do not form a valid triangle."

def test_another_invalid_triangle():
    try:
        solution(100, 80, 10)
        assert False, "Expected ValueError"
    except ValueError as e:
        assert str(e) == "The angles do not form a valid triangle."

def test_zero_angle():
    try:
        solution(0, 90, 90)
        assert False, "Expected ValueError"
    except ValueError as e:
        assert str(e) == "The angles do not form a valid triangle."
```
<|Test End|>

This solution and test suite should now correctly handle the triangle checks and bitwise rotation logic.
