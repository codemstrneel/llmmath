QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that processes a list of integer pairs and a list of tuples. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Identify the longest chain of pairs in which each pair (a, b) can be connected to another pair (c, d) if b < c, similar to finding the longest chain of pairs.
2. Within the identified longest chain, use each pair (a, b) to filter elements from the list of tuples. Specifically, select tuples where the first element is within the interval [a, b]. Remove from each tuple any elements that are either `None` or duplicated within that tuple.
3. For each tuple that remains after filtering and cleaning, check if it contains any negative numbers. If it does, move all negative numbers to the start of the tuple while maintaining the order of non-negative numbers.
4. Return the list of processed tuples that meet the above criteria while maintaining the relative order of the original pairs.

**Example Input:**
- Pairs: `[(1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 6)]`
- Tuples: `[(2, None, 2, -5, 3), (4, 5, None, 5, -1), (6, 0, 5, None, -3, -4), (7, 8)]`

**Expected Output:**
- List of processed tuples: `[(-5, 3), (-1, 4), (-4, -3, 6, 0, 5)]`

This question combines the concept of finding the longest chain of pairs with the operation of filtering and cleaning tuples. It also incorporates elements of reordering based on conditions from other questions, focusing on tuple manipulation and number arrangement.
