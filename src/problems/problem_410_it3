QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of strings, where each string represents a URL containing a date in "YYYY/MM/DD" format, and a target integer. For each string, extract the year, month, and day from the URL using regular expressions. Calculate the sum of the year, month, and day, and check if this sum is divisible by the target integer. If divisible, modify the URL by interchanging the positions of the year and the day within the URL. Then, divide the list of modified URLs into smaller sublists, each containing n URLs, discarding any URLs that do not fit into complete sublists. Return the list of sublists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the solution and ensure that our code and tests work correctly together. Here's the updated solution and test cases:

1. **Solution Fixes**: Ensure that the logic for swapping and slicing the lists correctly reflect our requirements.
2. **Test Cases**: Verify that the test expectations align with the functionality described.

The tests are updated to accurately check the conditions of swapping and grouping based on the solution logic. This should ensure that we test only correct instances where the date sum is divisible by the target.
