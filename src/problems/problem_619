QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that processes a given text paragraph and a matrix of tuples, where each tuple contains a set of integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. In the text paragraph, replace all spaces with the string '%20'.
2. Calculate the XOR for each pair of integers within each tuple in the matrix, for each unique row (consider rows as duplicates if they have equivalent sets of integers, similar to a multiset).
3. For each unique row, find the k most common integer results of the XOR operations, where k is specified as an input to the function.
4. Return a tuple containing:
   - The modified text paragraph.
   - A list of lists where each sublist includes the k most common XOR results for each unique row, along with their counts in the format `(XOR_value, count)`.

### Example:

Given the following text and matrix:

```python
text = "Replace all spaces in this sentence."

matrix = [
    [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5)],
    [(5, 4), (2, 1, 3)],
    [(1, 2, 3), (5, 4)],
    [(10, 12), (15, 20)]
]
```

And `k = 2`, the function should return:

```python
(
    "Replace%20all%20spaces%20in%20this%20sentence.",
    [
        [(3, 2), (7, 1)],  # For the unique row [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5)], calculate XOR pairs and find top 2
        [(7, 1), (3, 1)],  # For the unique row [(5, 4), (2, 1, 3)], calculate XOR pairs and find top 2
        [(18, 1), (27, 1)] # For the unique row [(10, 12), (15, 20)], calculate XOR pairs and find top 2
    ]
)
```

Note: The XOR results and their counts are illustrative examples; your actual implementation might give more context-specific results based on the input provided.
