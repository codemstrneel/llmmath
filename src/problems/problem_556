```python

    assert sum_of_evens(10) == 30  # 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30

    assert sum_of_evens(9) == 20  # 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20

def test_sum_of_evens_with_n_zero():
    assert sum_of_evens(0) == 0  # No even numbers to sum

def test_sum_of_evens_with_small_n():
    assert sum_of_evens(1) == 0  # No even numbers between 1 and 1

def test_sum_of_evens_with_single_even_n():
    assert sum_of_evens(2) == 2  # Only 2 is even
