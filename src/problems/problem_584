QUESTION

**Novel Question:**

Design a Python function that processes a list of integers, two additional integers \( m \) and \( n \), and a string that contains alphanumeric characters. The function should achieve the following tasks:

1. **List and String Transformation**:
   - Remove every m-th integer from the list, initiated after a left-rotation of the list by the number of alphabetic characters present in the input string.
   - Replace the initial string with the sequence of these removed integers concatenated together as a string.

2. **Arithmetic Operations and Range Analysis**:
   - Calculate the sum of all even numbers in the modified list.
   - Check the characters in the transformed string: For every character with an even ASCII value, convert the character to its ASCII number and add it to the sum calculated previously.
   - Evaluate if the numbers at the even-indexed positions in the modified list form an arithmetic progression, and identify the common difference.

3. **Complex Conditional Evaluation**:
   - If the common difference exists and isn't zero, determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of this common difference with the total sum obtained.
   - Check if the product of \( n \) and the length of the initial list modulo the calculated GCD surpasses 100.
   - If it surpasses, return a string composed of the removed integers if they were sorted in descending order, delimited by dashes ('-').
   - If not, return how many such removed integers exist as an uppercase string if it is even, else return the sum of ASCII values of the initial string in binary format.

This question integrates elements of list manipulation, string processing, arithmetic progression evaluation, numerical operations, and conditionally advanced decision-makingâ€”synergizing multiple fundamental programming notions to test deeper understanding and fluency in algorithm design and implementation.

Example Inputs/Outputs:

- Input: integers = [10, 20, 15, 25], m = 2, n = 5, string = "abc96"
  Output: "75-25" (Rotate by 3, remove every 2nd element starting at 1, progression exists, GCD condition exceeded)

- Input: integers = [12, 22, 34], m = 3, n = 4, string = "check"
  Output: "11011001000110" (Rotate by 5, remove every 3rd element starting at 0, common difference non-zero, not surpassing condition)

This question combines aspects of list processing, conditional logic, and arithmetic analysis, challenging participants to craft a concise, efficient, and creative solution.
