QUESTION

Write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon that fits perfectly within a circle of a given radius, and return the resulting string representation of the area with all parentheses removed.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we must calculate the area of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle of a given radius. The formula to calculate the area of a regular n-sided polygon inscribed in a circle with radius \( R \) is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot n \cdot R^2 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)
\]

We'll use Python's math library to perform the necessary trigonometric calculations. After calculating the area, we will convert it to a string, and remove any parentheses from it if they exist, before returning the result. However, since we're only dealing with a real number (the area), the resulting string doesn't initially contain parentheses in any typical scenario, but we'll proceed as if removing parentheses is a necessary step for compliance.

Let's implement the solution:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import math

def solution(n, R):
    """
    Calculates the area of a regular n-sided polygon inscribed in a circle with radius R
    and returns the string representation of the area with parentheses removed (if any).
    """
    # Calculate the area using the formula
    area = 0.5 * n * R**2 * math.sin((2 * math.pi) / n)
    
    # Convert the area to a string
    area_str = str(area)
    
    # Remove parentheses if any, this is mostly just formality as area doesn't contain parentheses
    # by default in this case.
    area_str_no_parens = area_str.replace('(', '').replace(')', '')
    
    return area_str_no_parens
```
<|Solution End|>

Now, let's write unit tests for this function:

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution
import math

def test_area_of_inscribed_square():
    R = 1
    n = 4
    expected = str(R**2)  # Square area for radius 1 is side^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2
    assert solution(n, R) == expected

def test_area_of_inscribed_triangle():
    R = 1
    n = 3
    expected_area = 0.5 * n * R**2 * math.sin((2 * math.pi) / n)
    assert solution(n, R) == str(expected_area)

def test_area_with_five_sides():
    R = 2
    n = 5
    expected_area = 0.5 * n * R**2 * math.sin((2 * math.pi) / n)
    assert solution(n, R) == str(expected_area)

def test_area_large_number_of_sides():
    R = 10
    n = 100
    expected_area = 0.5 * n * R**2 * math.sin((2 * math.pi) / n)
    assert solution(n, R) == str(expected_area)

def test_no_parentheses():
    # Check if the resulting string contains parentheses, it shouldn't
    R = 5
    n = 6
    area_str = solution(n, R)
    assert '(' not in area_str and ')' not in area_str
```
<|Test End|>

This set of tests covers various polygons with different numbers of sides and radius values, ensuring that the function behaves as expected and confirms that the output properly excludes parentheses.
