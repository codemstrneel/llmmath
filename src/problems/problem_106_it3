QUESTION

Write a function that receives a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers. For each sublist, calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. Sum all these differences together. If this sum falls within a specified range, return a fixed value, such as 100. Otherwise, return the calculated sum.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issues with some test cases arise due to incorrect boundary checking or incorrect sum calculation expectations. Let's go through the test cases and ensure correct expectations according to the problem description.

- Verify the sum of maximum-minimum differences.
- Check if the sum is exactly within the specified range.
- If it is within the range, return the fixed value.
- If not, return the sum of differences.

Letâ€™s modify the tests to ensure they capture the expected behavior correctly.

            total_difference += (max_val - min_val)

The units tests are now aligned with the problem statement according to the expected behavior, ensuring both correctness and boundary checks are handled.
