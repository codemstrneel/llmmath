QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes three inputs: a list of integers, a list of strings, and a key (which corresponds to an index in the list of strings). The function should first create a new list by replacing each integer in the integers list with the factorial of that integer. Then, use the map function to list out each string in the strings list. Finally, determine if there's a tuple in the strings list and count the elements until the first tuple, if present. The function should return a tuple with three elements: the integer at the specified index from the original strings list, the modified list of integers with their factorials, and the count of elements until the first tuple in the strings list (or the total count if no tuple is found). Use recursion for factorial calculation.
