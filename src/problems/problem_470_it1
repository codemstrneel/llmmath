QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of lists (sublists) and also accepts a range tuple. For each sublist, extract the last element and compute the modulo of that element with each element of a second provided tuple. If the modulo of any element is within the given range, replace that element with 20. Return a list of the modified sublists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The current solution as implemented does not correctly handle the problem statement. It checks the modulo condition for the last element of each sublist and modifies all elements of the sublist if the condition is met, rather than just replacing the element being checked. Let's correct the implementation to adhere to the stated requirements and update the tests accordingly.

The function needs to:
1. Extract the last element of each sublist.
2. Calculate the modulo of each element in the sublist with each number in the mod_tuple.
3. If the result of the modulo operation is within the specified range, replace only that element with 20.

Let's revise the solution and the tests to verify this corrected behavior.
