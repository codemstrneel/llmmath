QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of integers, a list of tuples, and a string. The function should:

1. Use a lambda function to filter out numbers from the list of integers that are divisible by at least one distinct prime number present in any of the tuples. Ignore any `None` values in the tuples.
2. Construct a dictionary where the keys are the distinct characters that appear most frequently at the end of the string, and the values are the filtered numbers from step 1 that are divisible by the number of occurrences of each character.
3. Return a list of tuples containing:
   - The sum of values from each dictionary value list.
   - A boolean indicating whether the sum is a polite number â€” a number that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive integers.
   - The even parity (True if even, False if odd) of the count of such sums in the dictionary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there was a syntax issue in our provided code blocks. Let's ensure that the code is properly formatted and any syntax issues are resolved. Additionally, we need to make sure that all logic aligns with the problem statement and requirements.

Let's correct this:

1. Ensure the code has the correct syntax (especially for the test cases).
2. Fix any logical issues in the code related to step 4, regarding how the final result list is constructed.

Here is the corrected solution and test code:

```python
def solution(int_list, tuples_list, input_string):
    from collections import Counter
    import math
    
    def is_prime(num):
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    def extract_primes(tuples_list):
        primes = set()
        for tup in tuples_list:
            for el in tup:
                if el is not None and is_prime(el):
                    primes.add(el)
        return primes
    
    def is_polite_number(num):
        # Polite numbers (except 1) are all numbers that are not powers of 2
        return num != 1 and (num & (num - 1)) != 0
    
    # Step 1: Filter numbers from int_list
    primes_set = extract_primes(tuples_list)
    filtered_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: any(x % p == 0 for p in primes_set), int_list))
    
    # Step 2: Determine most frequent characters at the end of the string
    if not input_string:
        return []
    
    char_counter = Counter(input_string)
    max_frequency = max(char_counter.values())
    most_common_chars = [char for char, freq in char_counter.items() if freq == max_frequency]
    
    # Step 3: Construct dictionary
    result_dict = {}
    for char in most_common_chars:
        char_count = char_counter[char]
        result_dict[char] = [num for num in filtered_numbers if num % char_count == 0]
    
    # Step 4: Construct the result list
    result_list = []
    for values in result_dict.values():
        total = sum(values)
        is_polite = is_polite_number(total)
        parity_even = len(filtered_numbers) % 2 == 0
        result_list.append((total, is_polite, parity_even))
    
    return result_list
```

    result = solution(int_list, tuples_list, input_string)
    assert result == [(72, True, False)], "Test case 1 failed"

    input_string = "zzzzzzzzzx"
    result = solution(int_list, tuples_list, input_string)
    assert result == [(144, True, False)], "Test case 3 failed"

def test_case_no_primes():
    int_list = [10, 14, 18, 22]
    tuples_list = [(4, 6), (8, 9)]
    input_string = "abcd"
    result = solution(int_list, tuples_list, input_string)
    assert result == [], "Test case no primes failed"

def test_case_empty_string():
    int_list = [12, 15, 18, 20]
    tuples_list = [(2, 3), (5, 7)]
    input_string = ""
    result = solution(int_list, tuples_list, input_string)
    assert result == [], "Test case empty string failed"
```

<|Test End|>

I've corrected the conditions and added handling for cases where the most frequent characters and other logic might impact the results. The tests are designed to reflect expected behavior per the given conditions.
