QUESTION

Create a function that takes two lists of numbers and performs a combined operation inspired by sorting and element-wise manipulation. The function should process the lists in a single pass and return a new list merged from the two lists based on the following rules:

1. If both corresponding elements in the lists are zero, place a zero in the resulting list.
2. If both elements are positive, add them together and append the result to the list.
3. If both elements are negative, calculate the modulo of the absolute values (ignoring any zero division possibility, handle it gracefully), and append the result to the list.
4. If one element is positive and the other is negative, append the product of the absolute values to the list.

For example, given the lists `[0, 3, -4, 2]` and `[0, 2, -3, -1]`, the function should return `[0, 5, 1, 2]`, explained as:
- For the first pair `(0, 0)`, both are zero, so append `0`.
- For the second pair `(3, 2)`, both are positive, so append `3 + 2 = 5`.
- For the third pair `(-4, -3)`, both are negative, so append `abs(-4) % abs(-3) = 1`.
- For the fourth pair `(2, -1)`, one is positive and the other is negative, so append `abs(2) * abs(-1) = 2`.
