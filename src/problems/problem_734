QUESTION

**Composite Coding Challenge:**

Create an advanced Python function that integrates sequence processing, binary manipulation, and mathematical operations. Your task is to manage a mixed collection of strings containing numbers and words with unique operations related to both Jacobsthal number sequences and bit manipulation.

**Task Requirements:**

1. **Extractive Processing of Strings:**
   - Parse each string to identify sequences where words start with an uppercase letter. Measure the number of letters in each word.
   - Identify and extract consecutive pairs of numbers. If a string contains fewer than two numbers, discard it.

2. **Sequence Calculation:**
   - For each word block (sequence starting with an uppercase letter), compute a modified Jacobsthal number sequence based on the number of letters in the word. (For instance, if the word has 4 letters, use modified Jacobsthal numbers up to the 4th term).
   - Convert these numbers to binary and toggle all but the most significant (first) and least significant (last) bits.

3. **Balancing Operation:**
   - Calculate the "balanced" state of the toggled number using modulo 3 (determining if equidistant to 0, 1, or 2).
   - Based on the "balanced" state, compute a mathematical sum of squares from 1 up to the "balance."

4. **Output:**
   - For each string, output a dictionary where keys are the processed strings and values are tuples containing the following:
     - A sorted list of extracted tuples based on their sum.
     - A list of calculated sums of squares based on the computed "balanced" state.

For example, given the list:
```python
["Welcome 4 world 3 hello 7",
 "Data 8 science 6 is 9 fun",
 "Python 3.6 is powerful 9 2 tool"]
```

The function should output a dictionary reflecting processed tuples and balanced calculations, using the transformations above. 

This question requires combining concepts related to binary operations, sequence manipulation, and list sorting, and will test both algorithmic thinking and proficiency in Python data types and methods.
