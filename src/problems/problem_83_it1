QUESTION

Write a Python function that computes the maximum sum of squares of the binomial coefficients mod p for a given periodic function.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The problem description involves calculations related to the maximum sum of squares of the binomial coefficients mod `p`, and it seems specific to a particular mathematical context. If a test is failing, it indicates that the current solution or the understanding of the test case expectations may be incorrect. Let's address the failing test case.

Looking at the provided test function `test_larger_modulus`, there appears to be an expectation for calculating binomial coefficients squared sums under a modulus operation. Let's ensure the calculation aligns with expectations:

- For `n = 4`, the binomial coefficients are `1, 4, 6, 4, 1`.
- Squaring each gives `1, 16, 36, 16, 1`.
- Their sum is `70`.
- `70 % 1000 == 70`.

### Solution Code:
The solution in the initial attempt is correct, given the task description.

### Modified Unit Test Code:
Here, I will correct the test case for the larger modulus and ensure all tests pass as intended by adjusting the expectation for the `test_larger_modulus` function:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n, p):
    """
    Computes the maximum sum of squares of the binomial coefficients mod p.

    Args:
    n : int - The degree of the binomial coefficients.
    p : int - The modulus.

    Returns:
    int - The maximum sum of squares of the binomial coefficients mod p.
    """
    from math import comb

    sum_of_squares = 0
    for k in range(n + 1):
        binom_coef = comb(n, k)
        sum_of_squares += binom_coef ** 2
    
    return sum_of_squares % p
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_small_n_mod_small_p():
    assert solution(2, 5) == 1  # (1^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) % 5 == 6 % 5 == 1

def test_zero_modulus():
    assert solution(5, 1) == 0  # anything % 1 == 0

def test_large_n_small_mod():
    assert solution(3, 10) == 0  # (1^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 1^2) % 10 == 20 % 10 == 0

def test_larger_modulus():
    assert solution(4, 1000) == 70  # Fixed based on correct sum of binomial squares being 70 

def test_edge_case_n_zero():
    assert solution(0, 7) == 1  # C(0,0) = 1, and 1^2 % 7 == 1

def test_single_mod():
    assert solution(6, 2) == 0  # because sum of squares is always even, result % 2 == 0
<|Test End|>
```

With these adjustments, all tests should pass, aligning the expectations with the calculations.
