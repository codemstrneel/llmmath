QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a string and performs the following tasks: First, extract all numbers from the string and store both the numbers and their respective positions. Second, filter these numbers to find those that are both even and perfect squares. Return a tuple where the first element is a list of these numbers with their original positions in the string, and the second element is another list where the first number is moved to the end of the list.

def solution(s):
    import re
    from math import isqrt

    # Extract numbers with their positions
    numbers_positions = [(int(number), match.start()) for match in re.finditer(r'\d+', s) for number in [match.group()]]

    # Function to check perfect square
    def is_perfect_square(n):
        return n == isqrt(n) ** 2

    # Filter for even perfect squares
    even_perfect_squares = [(number, pos) for number, pos in numbers_positions if number % 2 == 0 and is_perfect_square(number)]

    # Move the first element to the end of the list
    if even_perfect_squares:
        rearranged = even_perfect_squares[1:] + even_perfect_squares[:1]
    else:
        rearranged = []

    return even_perfect_squares, rearranged
