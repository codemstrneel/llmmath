QUESTION

Write a function that, given a binary tree where each node contains an integer, returns the maximum product of values from any two unique nodes of the tree. Consider maximizing the product across the node values by traversing the tree efficiently.

SOLUTION/TESTS

There seems to be a misunderstanding related to the syntax errors encountered during the testing phase. Let's review and ensure all syntax and structure is correct.

The issue might have stemmed from incorrect formatting for the demarcation of code blocks using triple backticks. Let's refine the sections to ensure the code executes correctly.

Here is the revised solution along with properly formatted and implementation-independent tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def solution(root):
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        return dfs(node.left) + [node.value] + dfs(node.right)
    
    node_values = dfs(root)
    
    if len(node_values) < 2:
        return 0
    
    # Find the two largest values to get the maximum product
    max1, max2 = float('-inf'), float('-inf')
    for val in node_values:
        if val > max1:
            max2 = max1
            max1 = val
        elif val > max2:
            max2 = val
    
    return max1 * max2
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution, TreeNode

def test_two_node_tree():
    root = TreeNode(2)
    root.right = TreeNode(3)
    assert solution(root) == 6

def test_full_binary_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), TreeNode(3))
    assert solution(root) == 15  # Maximum product is 5 * 3 = 15

def test_single_node_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    assert solution(root) == 0  # Cannot form product with a single node

def test_zero_value_node():
    root = TreeNode(0, TreeNode(3), TreeNode(7))
    assert solution(root) == 21  # Maximum product is 3 * 7 = 21

def test_large_values():
    root = TreeNode(10, TreeNode(9), TreeNode(8))
    assert solution(root) == 90  # Maximum product is 10 * 9 = 90

def test_negative_values():
    root = TreeNode(-1, TreeNode(-2), TreeNode(-3))
    assert solution(root) == 6  # Maximum product of negative numbers

def test_mixed_sign_values():
    root = TreeNode(-10, TreeNode(9), TreeNode(8))
    assert solution(root) == 72  # Maximum product from non-negative

def test_all_zero_values():
    root = TreeNode(0, TreeNode(0), TreeNode(0))
    assert solution(root) == 0  # All nodes are zero, product is zero
```
<|Test End|>

### Explanation
- **Solution**: An optimization is made by tracking only the two largest values to calculate the maximum product, reducing unnecessary comparisons.
- **Tests**: The tests cover various edge cases such as trees with:
  - Two nodes, single node, both positive and negative values.
  - Mixed positive and negative, zero values, and large numbers.
  - This ensures the solution's robustness irrespective of input variations.
