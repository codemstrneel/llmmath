QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list as input and groups every two adjacent elements into sublists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the chat history, it appears that all tests passed except for `test_large_list`. To resolve this, I will analyze the code and tests to ensure accuracy and consistency. The test seems to fail due to an incorrect expectation setup for larger inputs. I will adjust the expected output of the `test_large_list` to match the correct behavior of the function. After making these adjustments, I will rerun the tests to verify the solution.

Let's proceed with the updated test:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(lst):
    """
    Takes a list and groups every two adjacent elements into sublists.
    If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element will be in a sublist by itself.

    Parameters:
    lst (list): The list to group.

    Returns:
    list: A list of sublists, where each sublist contains up to two elements from the input list.
    """
    return [lst[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(lst), 2)]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_even_number_of_elements():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

def test_odd_number_of_elements():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]

def test_single_element():
    assert solution([1]) == [[1]]

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([]) == []

def test_string_elements():
    assert solution(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) == [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]

def test_mixed_elements():
    assert solution([1, 'b', 3, 'd', True]) == [[1, 'b'], [3, 'd'], [True]]
    
def test_large_list():
    input_list = list(range(1, 101))  # List from 1 to 100
    expected = [[input_list[i], input_list[i + 1]] for i in range(0, len(input_list) - 1, 2)]
    assert solution(input_list) == expected
```
<|Test End|>

With this update, I am verifying that the `test_large_list` is set up properly to handle a large list from 1 to 100, where pairs from [1, 2] up to [99, 100] are expected. Let's run the tests again to verify the validity of the solution.
