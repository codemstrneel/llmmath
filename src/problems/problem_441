QUESTION

**New Combined Question:**

Create a Python function that processes both string data and numerical data with specific transformations and analyses. The function should integrate different aspects from your provided questions as follows:

1. **String and Numerical Tuple Analysis:**
   - You are given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a string and a number. Perform the following tasks:
     - Filter out tuples where the number is not a positive integer.
     - For the remaining tuples, create a dictionary where each string is a key, and its value is a tuple. The first element of this tuple is the number of vowels in the string, and the second element is the count of characters that have vowels as their neighbors.

2. **String Modification and Pattern Check:**
   - Given another input string, replace each sequence of whitespace with a single space.
   - Determine if the modified string contains any sequence of numbers that forms an arithmetic progression â€” a sequence of numbers with a constant difference between consecutive terms.

3. **Division and Consecutive Analysis:**
   - Take two separate lists of integers and perform element-wise division using a lambda function within a map. If a division by zero would occur, ensure the result for that division is 'undefined.'
   - For the resulting list of division outcomes (ignoring 'undefined'), identify the longest subsequence of consecutive integers. Return both the length of this subsequence and the subsequences themselves.

The function should return a tuple containing three elements:

- The dictionary from the tuple analysis with strings mapped to their vowel-related metrics.
- A boolean indicating whether the modified string contains a valid arithmetic progression of numbers.
- A dictionary containing two keys: `"division_results"` with the filtered list of division outcomes, and `"longest_consecutive_sequence"` containing the length and the elements of the longest sequence of consecutive integers found.

**Function Signature:**

```python
def analyze_and_transform_data(tuples_list, input_string, num_list1, num_list2):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```

This question combines string manipulation, regular expression techniques, lambda and map functions for numerical data, and involves elements of detection for both arithmetic and consecutive sequences, reflecting a creative integration and expansion of the concepts from your original questions.
