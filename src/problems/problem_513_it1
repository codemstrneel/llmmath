QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a string representing a quadratic equation and returns a modified version of the string where whitespace is replaced by underscores. Additionally, the function should return a boolean indicating whether the quadratic has real solutions.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's fix the regular expression in the solution to correctly handle spaces and accommodate the common forms of quadratic equations. Additionally, adjust the tests to reflect accurate checking of the quadratic properties and the whitespace handling.

import re
from math import sqrt

def solution(equation):
    """
    Replace whitespace in the quadratic equation with underscores and check if the equation has real solutions.
    
    Args:
    equation: str - Quadratic equation of the form "ax^2 + bx + c = 0".
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (str, bool) - Modified equation with underscores and a boolean indicating if real solutions exist.
    """
    # Replace whitespace with underscores
    modified_equation = equation.replace(" ", "_")
    
    # Extract coefficients a, b, c from the equation using a more flexible pattern
    pattern = r"([-+]?\d*)x\^2\s*([-+]?\d*)x\s*([-+]?\d*)"
    match = re.search(pattern, equation.replace(" ", ""))

    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Equation does not match the required quadratic form ax^2 + bx + c.")

    a, b, c = match.groups()
    
    # Handling empty strings for coefficients
    def convert_coeff(coeff):
        if coeff in ["", "+"]:  # If empty or just '+', it represents 1
            return 1
        elif coeff == "-":      # If '-', it represents -1
            return -1
        else:
            return int(coeff)

    a = convert_coeff(a)
    b = convert_coeff(b)
    c = convert_coeff(c)
    
    # Calculate discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    
    # Determine if the quadratic equation has real solutions
    has_real_solutions = discriminant >= 0
    
    return modified_equation, has_real_solutions

<|Test End|>

This update includes fixes for the incorrect pattern matching of quadratic equations and correctly handles default coefficients. The revised test cases ensure a robust assessment of the implemented solution.
