QUESTION

Certainly! Based on the concepts of parsing and analyzing strings, as well as numerical constraints, here is a new coding question incorporating elements from your given questions:

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that processes a list of mixed strings and numbers, and fulfills the following requirements:

1. For each string in the list, use regex to separate the alphabets and numbers.
2. For each identified number, calculate the factorial of that number.
3. For the calculated factorial, determine the number of digits in it.
4. Finally, determine the minimum number of elements that should be removed from the list of these digit counts such that the difference between the highest and lowest digit count does not exceed a given value \( k \).

The function should return a list of tuples where each tuple contains:
   - An original number from the string
   - The number of digits in its factorial
   - The transformed word part, if any

Additionally, the function should return an integer indicating the minimum number of removals required to achieve the condition specified in step 4.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def process_strings_and_optimize(numbers: list, k: int) -> (list, int):
    pass
```

**Constraints:**
- The number in each string, if any, is a non-negative integer.
- The factorial calculation should handle numbers up to a reasonable limit (e.g., 10!) to avoid excessive computation.
- The transformed word parts should maintain their original order and casing, and should be returned as part of the list of tuples.
- Ensure robustness in identifying and processing each number separately in case of no or multiple numbers in a string.

This novel problem requires the use of string manipulation, regular expressions, numeric computations, and optimization in line with elements from several of the provided questions.

        for part in parts:
            if part.isdigit():
                num = int(part)
                if num <= 10:  # Limit to factorial of 10 for reasonable computation
                    fact = factorial(num)
                    num_digits = digits_in_number(fact)
                    digit_counts.append(num_digits)
                    result_tuples.append((num, num_digits, word_part))

    # Calculate required removals
    if not digit_counts:
        return result_tuples, 0

    digit_counts.sort()
    min_removals = float('inf')

    for i in range(len(digit_counts)):
        for j in range(i, len(digit_counts)):
            if digit_counts[j] - digit_counts[i] <= k:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, i + (len(digit_counts) - j - 1))

    return result_tuples, min_removals
