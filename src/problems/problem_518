QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integer tuples and an integer \( n \) and returns a new list according to the following transformations:

1. **Filtering Stage:** Remove any tuple that includes an integer below zero.
2. **Transformation Stage:** For each remaining tuple, clear the value of each integer by resetting it to 0 if the sum of the tuple is not divisible by \( n \).
3. **Chunking and Reordering Stage:** Split the list of transformed tuples into chunks of size \( n \). Within each chunk, reorder the tuples based on the sum of their original values, placing tuples with higher sums first.
4. **Final Aggregation Stage:** For each chunk, return the sum of lengths of the tuples within that chunk, along with the reordered tuples.
5. **Additional Condition:** If all integers within a chunk are zero after the transformation stage, exclude that chunk from the final result.

Examples:
- Given the list of tuples `[(3, 4), (-1, 5), (6, 2)]` and a chunk size of 2, the process first filters out the tuple `(-1, 5)`, transforms, and rearranges the remaining tuples into chunks, and produces the final output.
- Given the integers `[(3, 5), (10, 0), (2, 6), (9, 1)]` with \( n \) as 2, follow through the stages to produce a result.

This revised question includes an additional condition to increase complexity, requiring logical reasoning to manage list transformations and exclusions based on the final values within chunks.

Below is the solution to the problem, along with unit tests to verify the solution.
