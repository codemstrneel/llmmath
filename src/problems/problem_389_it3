QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of tuples, interchanges the first and last element of each tuple, and then removes any resulting tuples that are empty or contain only zeros.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issue you're experiencing is due to the placement of code block delimiters. Let's ensure that only the actual Python code is within the code blocks, and we remove any surrounding triple backticks (` ``` `) as they are not part of the necessary formatting within our sections.

Here's the corrected code:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(tuples_list):
    """
    Interchanges the first and last elements of each tuple in the list.
    Removes tuples that are empty or contain only zeros after the interchange.
    """
    result = []
    for t in tuples_list:
        if len(t) > 1:
            swapped = (t[-1],) + t[1:-1] + (t[0],)
        elif len(t) == 1:
            swapped = (t[0],)
        else:
            swapped = ()
        
        # Remove tuple if it's empty or contains only zeros
        if swapped and any(element != 0 for element in swapped):
            result.append(swapped)
    
    return result
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_interchange_and_remove_empty_or_zero_only_tuples():
    assert solution([(1, 2, 3), (4, 0), (0,)]) == [(3, 2, 1), (0, 4)]
    assert solution([(0, 0), (0, 0, 0), (5, 6, 0)]) == [(0, 6, 5)]
    assert solution([(), (0,), (0, 0)]) == []
    assert solution([(1,), (2, 3), (0, 1, 0)]) == [(1,), (3, 2), (0, 1)]
    assert solution([(9, 8, 0), (1, 0, 1)]) == [(0, 8, 9), (1, 0, 1)]

def test_single_element_tuples():
    assert solution([(0,), (5,)]) == [(5,)]
    assert solution([(0, 0, 0), (9,)]) == [(9,)]
    assert solution([(10,), (0, 0), ()]) == [(10,)]
    assert solution([(0,)]) == []

def test_no_change_needed():
    assert solution([(1, 0), (0, 3)]) == [(0, 1), (3, 0)]
    assert solution([(1, 2, 3), (3, 2, 1)]) == [(3, 2, 1), (1, 2, 3)]

def test_empty_input():
    assert solution([]) == []

def test_all_zero_tuples():
    assert solution([(0, 0, 0, 0), (0,)]) == []
```
<|Test End|>

This version should successfully compile and run the tests, as it now uses the correct format.
