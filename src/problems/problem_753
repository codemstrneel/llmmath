QUESTION

Create a Python function that takes an input string and a non-negative integer. First, remove all text enclosed in square brackets from the string. Then, identify all sequences of characters where a single digit is followed by one or more lowercase letters and return the position of the rightmost set bit of the length of these sequences in the binary representation of the input integer. If no such sequence is found outside square brackets, return -1. Make use of regular expressions and Python's built-in functions to achieve a concise and efficient solution. Edge cases such as empty strings and strings entirely made up of square bracketed content should be handled appropriately.

def rightmost_set_bit(input_str, num):
    """
    Removes square brackets and their contents from the input string.
    Finds all sequences where a digit is followed by lowercase letters.
    Returns the position of the rightmost set bit in the integer corresponding
    to the lengths of the found sequences.

    # Step 1: Remove all text enclosed in square brackets

    # Step 2: Find sequences where a digit is followed by one or more lowercase letters
    sequences = re.findall(r'\d[a-z]+', cleaned_str)
    
    # Step 3: If no sequences are found, return -1
    if not sequences:
        return -1
    
    # Step 4: Find the rightmost set bit of `num`
