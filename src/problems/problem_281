SOL & TESTS

<|Solution Begin|> 
```python
def perimeter_of_rhombus(side_length):
    """
    Calculate the perimeter of a rhombus given the length of one of its sides.
    
    Parameters:
    side_length (float or int): The length of one side of the rhombus.
    
    Returns:
    float or int: The perimeter of the rhombus.
    """
    return 4 * side_length

```python
from solution import perimeter_of_rhombus

def test_perimeter_of_rhombus_positive_numbers():
    assert perimeter_of_rhombus(5) == 20
    assert perimeter_of_rhombus(10) == 40

def test_perimeter_of_rhombus_zero_length():
    assert perimeter_of_rhombus(0) == 0

def test_perimeter_of_rhombus_float_length():
    assert perimeter_of_rhombus(2.5) == 10.0
    assert perimeter_of_rhombus(3.75) == 15.0

def test_perimeter_of_rhombus_negative_length():
    # Negative side length doesn't make sense for a rhombus, so we can either expect
    # an exception, or we assume the function is not meant to handle this.
    # Here we choose to ignore negative inputs for tests as per basic requirement understanding.
    pass
