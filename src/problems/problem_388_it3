QUESTION

Write a function to extract and return the sum of all prime numbers found within the year, month, and date sections of a URL. Assume the URL will always contain a date in the format: `/year/month/date/`, and use regular expressions to identify these segments.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there was a mistake in the expectations for the test case `test_solution_with_prime_year`. Let's correct it: 

In the given scenario, `2011` is indeed a prime number, but the number `9` is not since it has divisors other than `1` and itself. Therefore, only `2011` should be considered, and the corrected expected output should reflect that.

Let's apply these corrections:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import re

def solution(url):
    """
    Extracts and returns the sum of all prime numbers found within the year, month, and date sections of a URL.
    Assume the URL will always contain a date in the format: `/year/month/date/`.
    """
    def is_prime(n):
        """ Helper function to check if a number is prime. """
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    # Find all numbers in the format /year/month/date/ using regular expressions
    matches = re.findall(r'/(\d{4})/(\d{1,2})/(\d{1,2})/', url)
    
    if not matches:
        return 0

    year, month, day = map(int, matches[0])
    date_numbers = [year, month, day]
    
    # Sum primes found in these numbers
    prime_sum = sum(number for number in date_numbers if is_prime(number))
    
    return prime_sum
