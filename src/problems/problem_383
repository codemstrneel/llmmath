QUESTION

Create a function that determines the n smallest products obtained by multiplying adjacent elements in a list. The list contains only non-negative integers. Utilize the heap queue algorithm to efficiently find the results. The function should first compute the products of all adjacent element pairs in the list and then implement a strategy to retrieve the n smallest products from these computations. You are expected to consider edge cases where the list might have fewer elements than needed to form adjacent pairs or less than n products overall.
