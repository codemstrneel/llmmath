QUESTION

Create a Python function that extracts and returns the first element from each tuple in a list of tuples.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Below is the solution to extract the first element from each tuple in a list of tuples, and the unit tests to verify its correctness.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(tuples_list):
    """
    Extracts and returns the first element from each tuple in a list.
    
    Args:
    tuples_list: List[Tuple]
        A list of tuples from which to retrieve the first element of each.
        
    Returns:
    List
        A list containing the first element from each tuple in the input list.
    """
    return [t[0] for t in tuples_list]
