QUESTION

Write a Python function to evaluate whether a given quadratic equation has real solutions.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Below is the solution to determine if a quadratic equation has real solutions by evaluating if the discriminant is non-negative. The quadratic equation is generally in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). The discriminant is computed as \( b^2 - 4ac \).

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(a, b, c):
    """
    Evaluate if the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 has real solutions.
    
    Returns True if the equation has real solutions, otherwise False.
    """
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    return discriminant >= 0
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_real_solutions():
    assert solution(1, 4, 4) == True  # Discriminant: 16 - 16 = 0

def test_no_real_solutions():
    assert solution(1, 0, 1) == False  # Discriminant: 0 - 4 = -4

def test_one_real_solution():
    assert solution(1, -2, 1) == True  # Discriminant: 4 - 4 = 0

def test_two_real_solutions():
    assert solution(1, -3, 2) == True  # Discriminant: 9 - 8 = 1

def test_large_coefficients_real_solutions():
    assert solution(1e6, 1e6, 1) == True  # A large coefficient test
