QUESTION

Write a function to create an `n x n` matrix filled with consecutive integers starting from 1 in spiral order. Then, identify the first four distinct integers at the corners of the resulting matrix and determine whether these four integers, when arranged in non-increasing order, form a decreasing sequence. Your function should return True if they do, and False otherwise.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It looks like we need to adjust both the solution code and the test code slightly to ensure that the solution works as expected. Let's rework the logic to fill the matrix in spiral order and check the corners for a strictly decreasing sequence correctly. Then, we'll also update the test cases to verify the solution correctly.

Here's the fixed code:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n):
    """
    Create an `n x n` matrix filled with consecutive integers in spiral order.
    Return True if the distinct integers at the corners form a strictly decreasing sequence,
    otherwise return False.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Initialize an empty n x n matrix
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Initial positions and directions
    top, bottom = 0, n - 1
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    num = 1
    
    while top <= bottom and left <= right:
        # Fill the top row
        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            matrix[top][i] = num
            num += 1
        top += 1
        
        # Fill the right column
        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
            matrix[i][right] = num
            num += 1
        right -= 1
        
        if top <= bottom:
            # Fill the bottom row
            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):
                matrix[bottom][i] = num
                num += 1
            bottom -= 1
        
        if left <= right:
            # Fill the left column
            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):
                matrix[i][left] = num
                num += 1
            left += 1
    
    # Extract the first four distinct integers at the corners
    corners = [
        matrix[0][0],  # Top-left
        matrix[0][n - 1],  # Top-right
        matrix[n - 1][n - 1],  # Bottom-right
        matrix[n - 1][0]  # Bottom-left
    ]
    
    # Sort corners in non-increasing order
    corners.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Check if the corners form a strictly decreasing sequence
    return corners[0] > corners[1] > corners[2] > corners[3]
