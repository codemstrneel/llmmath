QUESTION

Create a Python function that takes a string as input, where the string represents the coefficients of a cubic equation and a sequence of space-separated integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Parse the string to separate the cubic equation coefficients from the sequence of integers.
2. Using the coefficients, determine whether the cubic equation has roots that form a symmetric pattern around the y-axis.
3. Find the longest sub-sequence of the provided integers such that elements in the sub-sequence are consecutive integers.
4. Return a dictionary with two keys: 'is_symmetric' (a boolean indicating if the cubic equation's roots are symmetric) and 'longest_consecutive_subsequence' (the length of the longest sub-sequence of consecutive integers).

This problem combines:
- Parsing and analyzing a cubic equation to check for symmetry (from Question 2).
- Identifying consecutive integer sequences within a list (from Question 1).
- Processing strings and handling multiple data types (from the general essence of Question 5).
