QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a function that receives a list of strings, where each string is a sentence potentially containing embedded numerical sequences, dates in the format "YYYY-MM-DD", and alongside URLs. Your function should achieve the following:

1. Utilize regular expressions to extract any dates, numerical sequences, and URLs from each sentence.
2. Reverse the order of words in each sentence while maintaining the original character order within each word.
3. Calculate the area of a rhombus using the longest numerical sequence as diagonals, assuming they are the numerical representations needed for area calculation. Optimize this calculation for very large integers.
4. Create a structured output where each sentence is linked to a dictionary containing the extracted date, the area of the rhombus calculated from the longest numerical sequence, and the reversed sentence.
5. Identify and report any duplicate numerical sequences across all sentences and note their frequency.
6. Consider only the URL with the longest path for each sentence for storing purposes.

**Example:**

```python
def analyze_and_transform(sentences):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Sample Input
sentences = [
    "Visit the stats page at http://example.com/stats/123/456 for details on 2023-07-25.",
    "Ensure backup at https://backupservice.com/7890 by 2023-07-25 for safety.",
    "Check your activity at http://activitylog.com/91234 for analysis.",
    "New features updated at https://featureupdate.com/Date/2023-09-01!"
]

# Sample Output
# {
#   "Visit the stats page at http://example.com/stats/456/123 for details on 2023-07-25.": 
#       {"date": "2023-07-25", "area_of_rhombus": 56088, "reversed_sentence": "details for 456/123 stats.example.com/http:// at page stats the Visit"},
#   "Ensure backup at https://backupservice.com/7890 by 2023-07-25 for safety.":
#       {"date": "2023-07-25", "area_of_rhombus": "N/A", "reversed_sentence": "safety for 2023-07-25 by 7890.com.backupservice/https:// at backup Ensure"},
#   "Check your activity at http://activitylog.com/91234 for analysis.":
#       {"date": "N/A", "area_of_rhombus": 0, "reversed_sentence": "analysis for activity at 91234.com.activitylog.http:// your Check"},
#   "New features updated at https://featureupdate.com/Date/2023-09-01!": 
#       {"date": "2023-09-01", "area_of_rhombus": "N/A", "reversed_sentence": "Date 2023-09-01/com.featureupdate/https:// at updated features New"},
#   "Duplicate Numerical Sequences": {"123": 1, "456": 1, "7890": 1, "91234": 1}
# }

output = analyze_and_transform(sentences)
print(output)
```

In this problem, you will apply advanced skills in string manipulation, regular expressions, arithmetic optimizations for large numbers, and data structure management to derive complex outputs from a set of sentences.
