QUESTION

New Question: Write a Python function to calculate the sum of the first `n` positive even numbers, and ensure that your solution operates efficiently even for very large values of `n` without causing excessive computational delay or memory usage.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve the problem of calculating the sum of the first `n` positive even numbers, we need to consider the sequence of even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 2n. Each of these can be expressed as 2 times its position in the sequence: 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, ..., 2xn. The sum can be derived using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers S = n(n + 1)/2. 

For even numbers, we have sum = 2 * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 2 * S. Using the formula for S:

\[ \text{Sum of first } n \text{ positive even numbers} = 2 * \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = n(n + 1) \]

This formula provides an efficient way to compute the desired sum because it involves only arithmetic operations and no iterative loops. Letâ€™s implement this logic in Python, and write some unit tests.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the first n positive even numbers.
    """
    return n * (n + 1)
<|Solution End|>
```

Now let's write the unit tests to ensure our solution is correct.

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_sum_of_first_n_positive_even_numbers():
    assert solution(1) == 2
    assert solution(2) == 6  # 2 + 4
    assert solution(3) == 12  # 2 + 4 + 6
    assert solution(10) == 110  # 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 20
    assert solution(0) == 0  # No positive even numbers
    assert solution(100) == 10100  # Test larger n
    assert solution(1000) == 1001000  # Test very large n

def test_large_values():
    # Test with very large value to ensure no performance issues
    assert solution(10**6) == 1000001000000
<|Test End|>
```

The solution and tests provided will ensure efficient and correct operation for both small and very large values of `n`.
