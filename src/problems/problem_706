QUESTION

Create a Python function that processes a string to identify and return the position of the rightmost set bit of the length of sequences consisting of one uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters. If no such sequence is found, the function should return -1. The function should handle edge cases such as empty strings or strings without uppercase letters followed by lowercase letters.

This problem combines the logic of identifying specific sequences from Question 3 and calculating the position of the rightmost set bit from Question 4.

def rightmost_set_bit_position(s):
    """
    Identifies sequences of one uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters
    and returns the position of the rightmost set bit in the length of such sequences.
    If no such sequence is found, returns -1.

    import re

    # Find all matches of sequences of one uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters
    matches = re.findall(r'[A-Z][a-z]+', s)
    
    if not matches:
        return -1

    # Calculate the lengths of all matches
    lengths = [len(match) for match in matches]
    max_length = max(lengths)

    # Calculate rightmost set bit position

    while max_length > 0:
        if max_length & 1:
