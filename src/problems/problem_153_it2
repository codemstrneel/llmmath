QUESTION

Write a function that checks if all elements of a smaller list are present in a larger list in the same order, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two integers representing the lengths of these lists. If the smaller list is not entirely present in the specified order within the larger list, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the solution by ensuring the Python syntax is valid and all cases are handled accurately.

### Guidelines:
1. If `small` is an empty list, it is always considered a subsequence.
2. If `small` is a subsequence of `large`, return the GCD of their lengths.
3. Return `-1` if `small` is not a subsequence of `large`.

### Updated Solution and Tests:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """
    Helper function to compute the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b.
    """
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def is_subsequence(small, large):
    """
    Helper function to determine if 'small' is a subsequence of 'large'.
    """
    it = iter(large)
    return all(item in it for item in small)

def solution(small, large):
    """
    Returns the GCD of lengths of small and large lists if 'small' is a subsequence of 'large',
    otherwise returns -1.
    """
    if is_subsequence(small, large):
        return gcd(len(small), len(large))
    return -1

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_gcd_of_list_lengths():
    assert solution([1, 2], [3, 1, 4, 2]) == 2
    assert solution([1, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == 1
    assert solution([1, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == 1
    assert solution([], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == 4
    assert solution([], []) == 0
    assert solution([1], [1]) == 1

def test_not_a_subsequence():
    assert solution([1, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == -1
    assert solution([2, 4], [1, 3, 4, 2]) == -1
    assert solution([2, 1], [1, 2, 3]) == -1
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 3, 5]) == -1

def test_empty_large():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], []) == -1
   
def test_smaller_in_large():
    assert solution([2], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 1
    assert solution([3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 1
```

### Key Points:
- Tests now use valid syntax and cover the specified edge cases.
- The solution logic matches all described problem requirements.
