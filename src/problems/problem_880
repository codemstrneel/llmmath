QUESTION

Given Question 1 and Question 3 focus on counting unique items in different contexts, here's a new problem that combines these core concepts in a novel way:

**New Question:**

Write a function that takes a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains key-value pairs where values are lists of strings. The function should return a dictionary where each key is a unique string that appears in the values across any of the dictionaries, and the corresponding value is the number of unique dictionaries it appears in. For example:

```python
def count_keys_in_dicts(dict_list):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage:
dict_list = [
    {'a': ['apple', 'banana'], 'b': ['banana', 'cherry']},
    {'c': ['apple', 'dragonfruit'], 'd': ['banana']},
    {'e': ['apple'], 'f': ['cherry', 'banana']}
]

# Returns: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 3, 'cherry': 2, 'dragonfruit': 1}
result = count_keys_in_dicts(dict_list)
print(result)
```

This question combines the idea of counting unique elements within a nested structure (from Question 1 and 3) with the challenge of processing nested collections in Python.
