QUESTION

Write a function that takes as input a dictionary and a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers. For each tuple, add the first integer to the dictionary as a key and the second as its initial value if the key does not already exist. If the key exists, subtract the second integer from the current value associated with the key. After processing all tuples, check if any key in the dictionary has a value less than the minimum of the last two elements of a separate list. Return a boolean indicating if such a key was found.
