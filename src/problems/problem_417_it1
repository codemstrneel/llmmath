QUESTION

Write a function to remove tuples with any None value from a list of tuples. Then find and return a list of unique index elements that appear across all remaining tuples at least once.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The task is to iterate over each tuple and filter out those with a `None` value, then collect and return unique elements from the remaining tuples. Upon reviewing the failed test involving mixed data types, it becomes evident that the issue is with sorting a list containing different data types (e.g., integers and strings). Sorting such a list is not always possible in Python3 due to the lack of natural ordering between those types. Therefore, the solution should not assume that it's possible to sort mixed types. The task doesn't specifically require a sorted output, so we can return the unique elements without sorting.

Let's refine the solution and update the tests accordingly.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(list_of_tuples):
    """
    Removes any tuple containing a None value from the list and 
    returns a list of unique elements that appear across the remaining tuples.
    """
    # Filter out tuples that contain None
    filtered_tuples = [t for t in list_of_tuples if None not in t]
    
    # Collect all elements from the remaining tuples and convert to a set to get unique values
    unique_elements = set()
    for t in filtered_tuples:
        unique_elements.update(t)

    # Return the list of unique elements (order doesn't matter since sorting is not required)
    return list(unique_elements)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_no_none_values():
    result = solution([(1, 2), (3, 4)])
    assert set(result) == {1, 2, 3, 4}

def test_some_none_values():
    result = solution([(1, 2), (None, 4), (3, None)])
    assert set(result) == {1, 2}

    result = solution([(None, 2), (3, 4), (3, None)])
    assert set(result) == {3, 4}

def test_all_none_values():
    assert solution([(None, None), (None, 4), (5, None)]) == []
    assert solution([(None, None)]) == []

def test_mixed_data_types():
    result = solution([(1, 'a'), ('b', 2), ('c', None), (3, 'd')])
    assert set(result) == {1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'd'}

def test_empty_list_of_tuples():
    assert solution([]) == []

def test_no_tuple_to_remove():
    result = solution([(1,), (2,), (3,)])
    assert set(result) == {1, 2, 3}

def test_single_tuples_with_none():
    assert solution([(None, 2)]) == []
    assert solution([(3, None)]) == []

def test_large_numbers():
    result = solution([(10**10, 10**11), (10**12, None)])
    assert set(result) == {10**10, 10**11}
<|Test End|>

The significant change here is in not trying to sort the result when returning, due to the restriction from mixing incomparable data types. The tests now use `set` to compare contents, validating the results without enforcing an order.
