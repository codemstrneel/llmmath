QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and rotates it by a specified number of positions to the left. After rotating the list, find the sum of squares of the indices of all elements whose rightmost set bit matches that of any other element in the rotated list. Return this sum; if no such elements exist, return -1.
