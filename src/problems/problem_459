QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a URL containing a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` and an integer `n`. The function should use regex to extract the year, month, and day from the URL and then create a list of integers starting from 1 to `n`. The function should then reverse the list from the start up to the position that is precisely the sum of the year, month, and day extracted from the URL. If the position exceeds the length of the list, only reverse up to the last position of the list.

### Example:

For the URL `"https://example.com/date/2023-08-15/info"` and `n=10`, the extracted date would be 2023, 08, 15. The sum is \(2023 + 8 + 15 = 2046\). Since 2046 exceeds the length of the list, reverse the whole list.

For the URL `"https://example.com/date/2021-05-11/info"` and `n=15`, the extracted date is 2021, 05, 11. The sum is \(2021 + 5 + 11 = 2037\). Since 2037 exceeds the length of the list, reverse the whole list.

### Constraints:

1. The URL will always contain a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. Assume that the list length will not be greater than 1000.
3. The list consists of integers from 1 to `n`.

    else:
        lst.reverse()
