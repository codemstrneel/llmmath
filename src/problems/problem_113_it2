QUESTION

Write a function that accepts a list of lists, where each sublist contains both integers and strings. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each sublist, determine if the first three integers form a valid triangle. If they do, and the sum of these three integers is even, calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum of these integers. Accumulate this difference for all valid triangles.

2. Scan each string in the sublist for numeric values. Using a given tuple containing two integers, increment each numeric value in each string by the first integer from the tuple. If any string in the sublist has a length (after incrementation) greater than the second integer of the tuple, ignore that string for further processing.

3. Return a dictionary with:
   - "triangle_diffs": the accumulated difference of valid triangle side lengths.
   - "valid_count": the total number of strings where all numeric values were adjusted and none exceeded the length restriction described.

Assume sublists with fewer than three integers should be ignored for the triangle check, and assume that only alphanumeric characters are present in the strings.

SOLUTION/TESTS

There seems to be a minor formatting error in the initial setup of the solution and unit test code. I'll correct this, ensure that the tests properly enforce the requirements, and verify that both triangles and string processing conform to the specifications.

Let's fix the syntax issue and refine the test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(list_of_lists, adjustment_tuple):
    def is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
        return a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b
    
    def process_string(s, increment, length_limit):
        new_length = 0
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                new_length += len(str(int(char) + increment))
            else:
                new_length += 1
                
            if new_length > length_limit:
                return False
        return True
    
    triangle_diffs = 0
    valid_count = 0
    
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Check for a valid triangle in the first three integers
        int_values = [val for val in sublist if isinstance(val, int)]
        if len(int_values) >= 3:
            a, b, c = int_values[:3]
            if is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
                if (a + b + c) % 2 == 0:
                    triangle_diffs += max(a, b, c) - min(a, b, c)
        
        # Process strings in the sublist
        strings = [val for val in sublist if isinstance(val, str)]
        increment, length_limit = adjustment_tuple
        
        for s in strings:
            if process_string(s, increment, length_limit):
                valid_count += 1
    
    return {"triangle_diffs": triangle_diffs, "valid_count": valid_count}
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_triangle_and_string_processing():
    # Test with both valid triangles and valid string processing
    assert solution([[3, 4, 5, "a1b", "12c"], [5, 12, 13, "34d"]], (1, 5)) == {"triangle_diffs": 3, "valid_count": 2}

def test_solution_no_valid_triangle_and_invalid_strings():
    # Test with no valid triangles and strings that fail length check
    assert solution([[1, 1, 2, "a9", "999z"]], (1, 5)) == {"triangle_diffs": 0, "valid_count": 0}

def test_solution_only_valid_triangles():
    # Test with only valid triangles, ensuring correctly accumulated difference
    assert solution([[6, 8, 10]], (5, 3)) == {"triangle_diffs": 10 - 6, "valid_count": 0}

def test_solution_only_valid_strings():
    # Test with only valid strings that do not exceed length limit
    assert solution([[1, 2, 3, "12a", "1b2"]], (1, 10)) == {"triangle_diffs": 0, "valid_count": 2}

def test_solution_ignore_sublist_with_few_integers():
    # Test sublists with fewer than three integers being ignored
    assert solution([[1, 2, "12a"], [9, "344c"], [3, 3, 3, "1"]], (2, 10)) == {"triangle_diffs": 0, "valid_count": 2}
```
<|Test End|>

The tests now cover both logic aspects: validating triangles and correctly adjusting strings without exceeding length constraints. The corrections should handle the logic effectively according to the task specifications.
