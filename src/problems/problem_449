QUESTION

Here's a new coding question that combines core concepts from the given questions:

**Combined Question:**

Create a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of strings and a list of integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. From the list of strings, identify the third most frequent word. Remove all occurrences of this word from the list, preserving the order of other words.
2. Remove duplicate integers from the list of integers, preserving the order of their first occurrences, and count how many integers were removed during this process.
3. Determine if the list of integers, after de-duplication, can be sorted by only using operations that remove either the first or last element and append it at the end or beginning, respectively.
4. Identify the smallest missing positive integer from the original list of integers (before removing duplicates).
5. Return a dictionary where each unique word from the modified list of strings (with the third most frequent word removed) is a key. The value for each key should be a tuple containing: the frequency of the word in the modified list and the number of strings (entire strings from the list) in which that word appears.

The function should return a tuple containing:

- The modified list of strings with the third most frequent word removed.
- The de-duplicated list of integers.
- The count of integers removed as duplicates.
- A boolean indicating if the list of integers can be sorted using the described operations.
- The smallest missing positive integer from the original list of integers.
- The dictionary of word frequencies and appearances.

Ensure the function handles edge cases such as empty input lists, cases where there is no third most frequent word, and lists with negative or zero values.

SOL & TESTS

```python
from collections import Counter

def analyze_inputs(str_list, int_list):
    # Task 1: Identify the third most frequent word and remove it
    word_counter = Counter(str_list)
    if len(word_counter) < 3:
        third_most_frequent_word = None
    else:
        third_most_frequent_word = word_counter.most_common(3)[-1][0]
    
    if third_most_frequent_word:
        modified_str_list = [word for word in str_list if word != third_most_frequent_word]
    else:
        modified_str_list = str_list[:]

    # Task 2: Remove duplicate integers and count removals
    seen = set()
    deduplicated_int_list = []
    for num in int_list:
        if num not in seen:
            deduplicated_int_list.append(num)
            seen.add(num)
    removed_count = len(int_list) - len(deduplicated_int_list)

    # Task 3: Check if list can be sorted by described operations
    def can_sort_by_operations(lst):
        return lst == sorted(lst) or lst[::-1] == sorted(lst)

    can_sort = can_sort_by_operations(deduplicated_int_list)

    # Task 4: Find the smallest missing positive integer
    def smallest_missing_positive(lst):
        lst = [num for num in lst if num > 0]
        lst_set = set(lst)
        smallest_missing = 1
        while smallest_missing in lst_set:
            smallest_missing += 1
        return smallest_missing

    smallest_missing = smallest_missing_positive(int_list)

    # Task 5: Construct word frequency and appearance dictionary from modified list
    modified_word_counter = Counter(modified_str_list)
    word_appearance_dict = {}
    
    for word in modified_word_counter:
        appearance_count = sum(1 for original_str in str_list if word in original_str)
        word_appearance_dict[word] = (modified_word_counter[word], appearance_count)

    return (
        modified_str_list,
        deduplicated_int_list,
        removed_count,
        can_sort,
        smallest_missing,
        word_appearance_dict
