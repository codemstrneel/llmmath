QUESTION

**Novel Combined Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a formatted string and a list of nested dictionaries with integer lists as values. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **String Processing:**
   - Accept a formatted string where each word is followed by its numeric length (e.g., "Python6", "coding6"). Parse the string and separate each word from its length.
   - For each word, check if the given length matches the actual length. Collect all words where the lengths mismatch.
   - Return the list of these words and their respective incorrect lengths as tuples in the form `("word", given_length)`.

2. **Nested Dictionary Processing:**
   - Accept a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains string keys mapped to lists of integers. Flatten these dictionaries into a single list of all unique integers.
   - Compute the factorial of each unique integer in this list if it is less than or equal to a given threshold (say 10 to handle computational limits).
   - Return a set of these factorial values.

3. **Return Value:**
   - Return a dictionary with the following keys:
     - "mismatching_words": A list of tuples containing words where the given length didn't match the actual length.
     - "factorials": A set of factorials for integers from the flattened integer list that are below the given threshold.

**Example:**

```python
def process_string_and_dictionaries(input_string, dictionary_list):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage
result = process_string_and_dictionaries(
    "Python6, coding5, fun3!",
    [{"key1": [2, 3, 5], "key2": [6, 9]}, {"another_key": [3, 4, 5]}]
)

print(result)
# Output:
# {
#   "mismatching_words": [("coding", 5), ("fun", 3)],  # Assuming lengths don't match or made up for example context
#   "factorials": {1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 362880}  # Factorials of integers <= 10 from [2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 4]
# }
```

This question integrates string manipulation involving parsing and validation, nested data structure flattening, and mathematical operations such as factorial computation to create a comprehensive programming challenge.
