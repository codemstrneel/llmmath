QUESTION

Write a function that takes a single string and a list of numbers as input. The function should return a dictionary where the keys are the non-repeated characters from the string that appear at the end of the string only if they are alphanumeric, and the values are the sum of prime numbers from 1 up to each number in the list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the problem once more by providing the Python solution and the corresponding unit tests. Below is the solution and the updated test suite, ensuring correct syntax and logical consistency.

## Solution:
The solution involves finding unique alphanumeric characters from the end of a string, and for each character, calculating the sum of primes up to each number in a list. We then map these characters to the calculated prime sums.

```python
def solution(s, lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        """Check if a number is a prime number."""
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    def sum_of_primes(n):
        """Return the sum of all prime numbers up to and including n."""
        return sum(x for x in range(2, n + 1) if is_prime(x))
    
    # Find non-repeated alphanumeric characters that appear at the end.
    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        if char.isalnum():
            if char in char_count:
                char_count[char] += 1
            else:
                char_count[char] = 1
    
    # Collect unique, non-repeated alphanumeric chars from the end.
    unique_chars = []
    for char in reversed(s):
        if char.isalnum() and char_count.get(char, 0) == 1 and char not in unique_chars:
            unique_chars.append(char)

    # Form the dictionary result with unique chars as keys and sum of primes as values.
    result = {char: sum(sum_of_primes(n) for n in lst) for char in unique_chars}
    
    return result
```

## Unit Tests:
The provided tests check different scenarios to ensure the solution behaves as expected.

```python

    lst = [5, 10]
    result = solution(s, lst)
    # Sum for n=5: 2+3+5=10, for n=10: 2+3+5+7=17; Total=10+17=27
    expected = {'d': 27}
    assert result == expected

def test_no_unique_alphanumeric_chars_at_end():
    s = "aabbcc"
    lst = [5, 7]
    result = solution(s, lst)
    expected = {}
    assert result == expected

def test_mixed_case():
    s = "abZ1"
    lst = [3, 11]
    result = solution(s, lst)
    # Sum for n=3: 2+3=5, for n=11: 2+3+5+7+11=28; Total=5+28=33
    expected = {'1': 33}
    assert result == expected

    s = "!@#"
    lst = [2, 3]
    result = solution(s, lst)
    expected = {}
    assert result == expected
    
def test_empty_string_and_non_empty_list():
    s = ""
    lst = [2, 3]
    result = solution(s, lst)
    expected = {}
    assert result == expected

def test_empty_list():
    s = "abcd123"
    lst = []
    result = solution(s, lst)
    expected = {'3': 0}
    assert result == expected

def test_single_repeated_character_string():
    s = "aaaaa"
    lst = [2, 5]
    result = solution(s, lst)
    expected = {}
    assert result == expected

def test_single_non_repeated_character():
    s = "z"
    lst = [10]
    result = solution(s, lst)
    # Sum of primes up to 10: 2+3+5+7=17
    expected = {'z': 17}
    assert result == expected
```
