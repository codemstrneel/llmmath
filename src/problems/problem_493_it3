QUESTION

Write a python function to calculate the sum of the first n odd natural numbers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems like there might have been formatting issues or syntax errors in previous attempts. Let's ensure that the code is correctly formatted and correct any potential problems. Below is the refined solution and its corresponding unit tests.

The task is to calculate the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers. The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers can be calculated using the formula \( n^2 \).

Here is the correct solution and the test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n):
    """
    Returns the sum of the first n odd natural numbers.
    An odd natural number sequence is: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
    The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n^2.
    For n <= 0, the sum is considered to be 0.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    return n * n
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_sum_of_first_n_odd_numbers():
    assert solution(1) == 1  # The first odd number is 1
    assert solution(2) == 4  # 1 + 3 = 4
    assert solution(3) == 9  # 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
    assert solution(4) == 16 # 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
    assert solution(5) == 25 # 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25

def test_zero_and_negative():
    assert solution(0) == 0  # Sum of zero odd numbers is 0
    assert solution(-1) == 0 # For negative n, sum should be 0
    assert solution(-5) == 0 # Another negative test case

def test_large_n():
    assert solution(100) == 10000  # 100^2 = 10000
    assert solution(1000) == 1000000  # 1000^2 = 1000000
```
<|Test End|>

This refined version should now execute without syntax errors and accurately test the solution. The functions and tests are formatted properly and the logic correctly handles both positive and edge cases.
