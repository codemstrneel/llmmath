QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of integers and a single integer `n` (with `n` given in binary format). The function will perform the following operations:

1. **Filter Integers:** From the list of integers, remove any number that is less than the decimal equivalent of the binary integer `n`.

2. **Binary Transformation and Sum Calculation:**
   - Convert `n` to its decimal form and rotate its binary representation to the left by one position.
   - Calculate and return the sum of the first `m` natural numbers, where `m` is the new decimal value after the binary rotation.

3. **Character Uniformity in Lists:**
   - For the remaining integers after filtering, convert each number to a string and check if all characters in each string are identical.
   - Return a list of booleans corresponding to each number, indicating whether the characters in the string representation of the number are uniform.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Return a tuple containing:
     - The list of booleans indicating character uniformity from step 3.
     - The sum calculated in step 2.

**Explanation of Combos:**

- **Combining Binary Manipulation and Filtering:** The problem uses binary number manipulation to transform and derive criteria for filtering integers and calculating sums.

- **Character Uniformity and Sum of Natural Numbers:** Like checking uniformity in character strings, the problem extends this to string representations of integers, combined with evaluating sum derived from transformed binary input.

This problem synthesizes various elements like filtering, binary transformation, and uniformity checks, creating a comprehensive challenge that leverages multiple concepts from the provided questions.

SOL & TESTS

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def process_numbers(int_list, n_binary):
    # Step 1: Convert n from binary to decimal
    n_decimal = int(n_binary, 2)

    # Step 2: Filter integers
    filtered_ints = [num for num in int_list if num >= n_decimal]

    # Step 3: Rotate binary n left and get new decimal
    n_binary_rotated = n_binary[1:] + n_binary[0]
    m_decimal = int(n_binary_rotated, 2)

    # Step 4: Calculate sum of first m natural numbers
    sum_m_natural = m_decimal * (m_decimal + 1) // 2

    # Step 5: Check and return character uniformity for each filtered integer
    uniformity_list = []
    for num in filtered_ints:
        num_str = str(num)
        uniformity_list.append(all(char == num_str[0] for char in num_str))  # Check if all characters are identical

    # Final output
    return uniformity_list, sum_m_natural
