QUESTION

Write a function that takes a string and returns a matrix. The matrix should be a square matrix (n x n, where n is the smallest integer such that n squared is greater than or equal to the length of the string) filled in a spiral order. Begin with the smallest character (based on alphabetical order) that appears more than once in the string, filling the matrix with available characters or empty strings if necessary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears there was a formatting mistake, specifically involving triple backticks around the code. To diagnose and resolve the problem effectively, I'll reformat the solution and test cases, providing them in a format without those specific issues while ensuring logical correctness.

Let's fix the formatting and logic:

### Solution

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(s):
    import math
    from collections import Counter

    # Step 1: Determine matrix size.
    n = math.ceil(math.sqrt(len(s)))

    # Step 2: Find the smallest character that appears more than once.
    char_count = Counter(s)
    repeated_chars = sorted([char for char in char_count if char_count[char] > 1])
    if repeated_chars:
        smallest_repeated_char = repeated_chars[0]
    else:
        smallest_repeated_char = sorted(s)[0]
    
    # Step 3: Sort string characters for orderly filling.
    sorted_chars = sorted(s)

    # Step 4: Create empty matrix.
    matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

    # Step 5: Prepare characters list start from the smallest repeated char.
    current_list = sorted_chars.copy()
    if smallest_repeated_char in current_list:
        current_list.remove(smallest_repeated_char)
    current_list.insert(0, smallest_repeated_char)

    # Step 6: Fill matrix in spiral order.
    index = 0
    row, col, direction = 0, 0, 0
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up

    for _ in range(n * n):
        if index < len(current_list):
            matrix[row][col] = current_list[index]
            index += 1
        else:
            matrix[row][col] = ''

        # Calculate the next position
        next_row, next_col = row + directions[direction][0], col + directions[direction][1]

        # Change direction if needed
        if not (0 <= next_row < n and 0 <= next_col < n and matrix[next_row][next_col] == ''):
            direction = (direction + 1) % 4
            next_row, next_col = row + directions[direction][0], col + directions[direction][1]

        row, col = next_row, next_col

    return matrix
```

### Tests

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_basic_repeated_start():
    matrix = solution("abcabc")
    expected = [
        ["a", "b", "c"],
        ["b", "c", ""],
        ["a", "", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected

def test_solution_no_repeated_chars():
    matrix = solution("abcdefg")
    expected = [
        ["a", "b", "c"],
        ["g", "", "d"],
        ["f", "e", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected

def test_solution_single_char():
    matrix = solution("a")
    expected = [
        ["a", ""],
        ["", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected

def test_solution_repeated_chars():
    matrix = solution("ededrdcdr")
    expected = [
        ["c", "d", "d"],
        ["r", "r", "e"],
        ["", "e", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected

def test_solution_even_length():
    matrix = solution("abcdefghij")
    expected = [
        ["a", "b", "c", "d"],
        ["h", "i", "j", "e"],
        ["g", "", "", "f"],
        ["", "", "", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected
```
<|Test End|>

These modifications address the misunderstood points in the initial solutions. This solution and corresponding tests should now effectively evaluate the spiral matrix creation logic, taking into account all necessary criteria stipulated by the problem.
