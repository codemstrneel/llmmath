QUESTION

Create a Python function that performs the following tasks:

1. Given an integer `n`, identify all even numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
2. For each even number, cube the number.
3. Calculate the running total of these cubes.
4. Determine if the calculated total can be the perimeter of a valid triangle given the constraints on triangle sides.

The function should then return a tuple with two elements: the total of the cubes of all even numbers, and a boolean indicating whether this total can form the perimeter of a valid triangle.

Function Signature:
```python
def cube_sum_and_triangle_check(n: int) -> (int, bool):
    pass
```

**Constraints:**
- A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
- Your function should validate the potential triangle with the perimeter equal to the sum of cubes of evens.
- The validation does not need specific side lengths, just the possibility of forming a triangle with any sides having this perimeter.
