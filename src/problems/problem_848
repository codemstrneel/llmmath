QUESTION

Write a function to determine the maximum number of buses that can be accommodated at a station at the same time, given their arrival and departure times.

SOL & TESTS

To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of buses that are at the station simultaneously. This is analogous to finding the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

The approach involves:
1. Sorting all arrival and departure times.
2. Using two pointers (or indices), iterate over the list of times.
3. Increment a counter for each arrival and decrement for each departure.
4. Keep track of the maximum count during the process.

Here is the implementation of the solution along with unit tests to verify its correctness.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def max_buses_at_station(arrival, departure):
    """
    Finds the maximum number of buses that can be accommodated at the station at the same time.
    
    Parameters:
    arrival (list): A list of arrival times of buses.
    departure (list): A list of departure times of buses.
    
    Returns:
    int: The maximum number of buses at the station at any time.
    """
    
    arrival.sort()
    departure.sort()
    
    n = len(arrival)
    
    max_buses = 0
    current_buses = 0
    i, j = 0, 0
    
    while i < n and j < n:
        if arrival[i] <= departure[j]:
            current_buses += 1
            max_buses = max(max_buses, current_buses)
            i += 1
        else:
            current_buses -= 1
            j += 1
    
    return max_buses
```
