QUESTION

Create a function that receives a list of tuples and a target range (defined by a minimum and a maximum). Each tuple consists of two elements: a string representation of a point and its x-coordinate. The function should first convert each tuple's string representation of x and y coordinates into integer values, then determine whether each point lies within the given target range on the x-axis. 

Additionally, calculate the slope between consecutive points that fall within the range and return a list of the slopes. Points are only considered consecutive if there are no intermediate points outside the range between them in the original list. If there are fewer than two points within the range, return an empty list for the slopes.

Here's how the problem might look in code form:

```python
def process_points_within_range(points, range_min, range_max):
    # The function implementation goes here

# Example input
points = [("3,4", 3), ("10,8", 10), ("5,12", 5)]
range_min = 4
range_max = 12

# Expected output
# This should return the list of slopes computed between points within the range on the x-axis.
```

This question combines the concepts of converting string data to integers (from Question 4) and determining the range of values (from Question 1), while also incorporating the calculation of slopes between points (based on Question 2).
