QUESTION

**Combined New Question:**

Write a Python function that accepts a list of mixed-type elements (integers, strings, and tuples) and performs the following operations to produce a structured result:

1. **Initial Filtering Phase:** 
   - Remove any element if:
     - It is an integer and is negative.
     - It is a string containing any digit.
     - It is a tuple containing any negative integers.

2. **Transformation and Grouping:**
   - For each remaining integer, calculate its square root if it is not perfect and cube it if it is. Group integers under 'imperfect' and 'perfect' based on this transformation.
   - For each string, if all characters are identical, determine its length and group strings by their character count (e.g., grouped by 1 character, 2 characters, etc.).
   - For each tuple, if the sum is divisible by 3, convert it to a list of its elements reversed; otherwise, swap the first and last elements. Group these under 'divisible by 3' and 'not divisible by 3'.

3. **Composite Chunking and Reordering:**
   - Create composite chunks such that each chunk contains one element from 'imperfect', 'perfect', character-counted strings, 'divisible by 3' and 'not divisible by 3' groups, if possible.
   - Reorder these chunks based on a priority order: 'perfect', strings with increasing character count, 'divisible by 3', 'imperfect', 'not divisible by 3'.

4. **Output Structure:**
   - Return a dictionary where each key corresponds to a chunk index and its value is a tuple with the combined sum of the lengths of items in the chunk (considering integers, strings, and tuple element lengths), alongside the reordered chunk.

**Example:**  
Given a list `[-5, "aaa23", (2, 7), (3, 3, 3), 4, "bbb", (1, 2, -1), "cc", 9, (6, 0)]`, the function will filter, transform, group, chunk, and reorder according to the rules, returning a comprehensive dictionary of results with structured grouping as explained. 

**Explanation of Combos:**

- **Filtering by Condition:** Elements from the problems are merged, such as filtering negative integers and adapting filtering logic to strings and tuples.
- **Transformation and Grouping:** This combines the string manipulation and grouping logic with numerical transformations, distinctly separating elements similar to the "minimum of three" problem's differentiation aspect.
- **Composite Chunking and Reordering:** This harmonizes with problem areas concerning reordering and chunking by first grouping into meaningful categories and then systematically organizing them.
- **Complex Output Structure:** Using dictionaries provides a more complex structure for final outputs, demanding an understanding of the transformations applied.
