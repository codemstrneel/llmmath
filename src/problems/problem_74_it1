QUESTION

Write a function that takes a camel case string, where each word represents a mathematical fraction (e.g., "OneHalf", "ThreeFourth"). The function should first verify if each word can be transformed into a valid fractional representation (e.g., verify "oneHalf" would translate to "1/2"). For each valid fraction, convert the camel case string to snake case and represent the fraction as a float. Then, for each float, determine its position as if it's an index and sum the corresponding elements from a given list of lists, ignoring any non-numeric elements. Return both the tuple of the floats and the total sum derived from the list of lists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's revisit the initial solution and the test cases to identify the issues and fix them accordingly.

### Issues in the Original Solution:
1. **Fraction Conversion Logic** was incorrect because it was based on splitting camel case into two snake words and looking up both in the dictionary independently.
2. **Index Calculation Logic**: The calculation of matrix indices from float values derived from fractions had errors; especially, the column index calculations were wrong.
3. **Assumption**: The code assumes a single camel case word per 'camel_case_string', but the question implies more generality.
4. **Matrix Indexing**: Direct use of floor division and column scaling might not yield correct indices.

### Revised Solution:
- I will update the fraction parsing logic to correctly understand and convert camel case words into float values.
- I will revise index calculation logic for accessing matrix elements accurately.
- Handle any exceptions and control flow to ignore non-numeric elements correctly.

### Explanation:
- The camel case string is converted to a fraction using the provided mappings.
- For each float, the position in the list is determined by scaling with respect to the length of the matrix.
- The calculation checks boundaries and only sums rows with valid numbers, appropriately based on the row identified by the fractional float value.
