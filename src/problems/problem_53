QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a function that takes a string representing a mathematical expression and checks two things: 

1. If the brackets (parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces) are properly balanced within the expression.
2. If the expression contains any pattern where a parenthesis is immediately succeeded by a lowercase letter 'a' and ends with a lowercase letter 'b' within the same bracket level, using regex.

The function should return a tuple with a boolean indicating if the expression is balanced and a list of all substrings matching the '(a...b)' pattern.

**Explanation:**

This question combines elements from Question 1 and Question 2. The first part of the task is checking for balanced brackets, similar to the task in Question 2 about checking balanced expressions. The second part adds a pattern-matching task similar to Question 1, but specifically within balanced parentheses and involving specific sequences of characters.

SOL & TESTS

Sure, here's how you can approach the problem:

1. **Balanced Brackets Check:** We'll use a stack to ensure the brackets (parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces) are balanced.
2. **Pattern Matching:** We'll use a regex pattern to find the substring pattern `'(a...b)'` where `...` can be any character within the string, ensuring it is enclosed by balanced brackets.

Let's implement this.

```python
import re

def check_expression(expression):
    def is_balanced(s):
        stack = []
        brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
        
        for char in s:
            if char in brackets.values():
                stack.append(char)
            elif char in brackets.keys():
                if not stack or brackets[char] != stack.pop():
                    return False
        return not stack

    def find_patterns(s):
        pattern = re.compile(r'\(a[^()]*?b\)')
        return pattern.findall(s)

    balanced = is_balanced(expression)
    patterns = find_patterns(expression) if balanced else []
    return balanced, patterns
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_balanced_and_pattern_found():
    expression = "(a_b)b {c[d]e} (a_xyz_b)"
    result = check_expression(expression)
    assert result[0] == True
    assert result[1] == ['(a_b)', '(a_xyz_b)']

def test_balanced_no_pattern():
    expression = "(a_b)b {c[d]e} (a_xy_z)"
    result = check_expression(expression)
    assert result[0] == True
    assert result[1] == ['(a_b)']

def test_not_balanced():
    expression = "(a_b)b {c[d]e (a_xyz_b"
    result = check_expression(expression)
    assert result[0] == False
    assert result[1] == []

def test_balanced_no_brackets_pattern():
    expression = "abcde fgh (ab)"
    result = check_expression(expression)
    assert result[0] == True
    assert result[1] == []

def test_empty_expression():
    expression = ""
    result = check_expression(expression)
    assert result[0] == True
    assert result[1] == []

def test_nested_brackets_pattern():
    expression = "(a_b) ((a_ab) [a_b])"
    result = check_expression(expression)
    assert result[0] == True
    assert result[1] == ['(a_b)', '(a_ab)', '(a_b)']
```

These unit tests cover scenarios where the function should check for balanced brackets and then find specific patterns within those balanced expressions. The use of pytest-style tests ensures each behavior is thoroughly checked.
