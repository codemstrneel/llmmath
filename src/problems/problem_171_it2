QUESTION

Write a function to find three closest elements from three sorted arrays, with the added condition that the function must handle arrays that include negative numbers and zeros, and it should operate efficiently even if the arrays have significantly different lengths (e.g., one is much longer than the others).

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's review the solution once more and ensure that both the solution function and the test cases are correctly implemented. I'll revise them to make sure the tests validate the solution accurately and all edge cases are covered.

### Solution Explanation
The objective is to find three elements, one from each of the three sorted arrays, such that the maximum difference between these elements is minimized. We use a three-pointer approach:

1. Initialize pointers `i`, `j`, and `k` to traverse through `arr1`, `arr2`, and `arr3` respectively.
2. Calculate the `current_min` and `current_max` for elements at these pointers.
3. Update `min_diff` and store the current triplet if it provides a smaller difference than previously recorded.
4. Move the pointer pointing to the current minimum element in an effort to minimize the difference further.

I'll modify the solution to ensure it is as clear as possible and adjust the tests based on correct logic.

### Revised Solution and Test Code

Let's refine both the solution and its test cases below.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(arr1, arr2, arr3):
    """
    Find three closest elements from three sorted arrays using a three-pointer approach.
    The function aims to minimize the maximum difference between the chosen elements.
    
    :param arr1: First sorted array (can include negative numbers and zero).
    :param arr2: Second sorted array (can include negative numbers and zero).
    :param arr3: Third sorted array (can include negative numbers and zero).
    :return: A tuple of three integers representing the closest elements.
    """
    i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
    closest_triplet = (arr1[0], arr2[0], arr3[0])
    min_diff = float('inf')

    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2) and k < len(arr3):
        current_triplet = (arr1[i], arr2[j], arr3[k])
        current_min = min(current_triplet)
        current_max = max(current_triplet)
        current_diff = current_max - current_min
        
        # Update if found a smaller difference
        if current_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = current_diff
            closest_triplet = current_triplet

        # Move the pointer of the array with the smallest current element
        if current_min == arr1[i]:
            i += 1
        elif current_min == arr2[j]:
            j += 1
        else:
            k += 1

    return closest_triplet

    arr2 = [2, 15, 20]
    arr3 = [10, 12]
    assert solution(arr1, arr2, arr3) == (10, 10, 10)

    arr2 = [-1e5, -1e4, -1e3]

    assert solution(arr1, arr2, arr3) == (0, -1000, 0)

```

This revision ensures that both solution logic and tests adhere to the problem's requirements. The test cases are more robust, checking several edge scenarios, including significant array length differences, presence of zero, and negative numbers. Adjustments have been made so that tests correctly evaluate the solution's logic for finding the minimal difference between element sets.
