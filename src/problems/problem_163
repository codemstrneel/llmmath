QUESTION

**New Question:**

Design a function that determines the maximum number of distinct tiles, each being a prime length and measured in either x, y, or z units, that can be used to exactly cover a floor of length m units without breaking any tiles. Additionally, the function should return the transformed output in the form of a frozen set, where each element represents the number of tiles used for each distinct prime length.

**Explanation:**

This new question combines elements from Questions 1, 3, and 4:

1. **From Question 1:** The concept of using tiles of specific lengths to cover a floor without breaking any tiles is retained.
2. **From Question 4:** The requirement that the lengths be distinct prime numbers is borrowed.
3. **From Question 3:** The result of the tile arrangement is presented as a frozen set, ensuring immutability and focusing on the transformation of data type. 

This creates a problem that blends the challenges of integrating mathematical constraints (prime lengths) with the transformation of data into a specific type (frozen set), ensuring a creative and novel combination of the core concepts.
