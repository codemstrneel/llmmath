QUESTION

Write a function that identifies whether the sequence of unique profit elements from one array exists as a contiguous subsequence in another array. If it does, return the gcd of the first subsequence of such unique profit elements found; otherwise, return None. Elements in the "profit array" are assumed to have a "profit" if they are positive.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the incorrect logic in the initial solution and update the tests for correctness, we need to ensure that the unique positive elements from the `profit` array are first ordered as they appear before they can be searched for as a contiguous subsequence in `sequence`. Additionally, the identification of unique elements and computing their GCD should be adjusted accordingly.

Here is the corrected solution and updated test suite:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
from math import gcd
from typing import List, Optional

def solution(profit: List[int], sequence: List[int]) -> Optional[int]:
    # Extract unique positive elements from the profit array, maintaining order
    seen = set()
    unique_profit_elements = []
    for x in profit:
        if x > 0 and x not in seen:
            seen.add(x)
            unique_profit_elements.append(x)
    
    # Check if unique_profit_elements is a contiguous subsequence in sequence
    n, m = len(sequence), len(unique_profit_elements)
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        if sequence[i:i+m] == unique_profit_elements:
            # Calculate gcd of the first subsequence of unique elements found
            return gcd_of_list(unique_profit_elements)
    
    return None

def gcd_of_list(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    result = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers[1:]:
        result = gcd(result, number)
    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_exact_subsequence_exists():
    assert solution([5, 5, 6, 8, 9], [5, 6, 8, 9, 10]) == 1  # [5, 6, 8, 9] is the unique profit

def test_no_subsequence():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], [9, 8, 7, 5]) == None

def test_subsequence_with_different_order():
    assert solution([3, 5, 9, 8], [8, 5, 3, 9]) == None  # Different order should not be subsequence

def test_empty_profit():
    assert solution([], [1, 2, 3]) == None  # No positive element in profit

def test_empty_sequence():
    assert solution([5, 6, 7], []) == None  # No sequence to find subsequence

def test_single_element_match():
    assert solution([5], [1, 2, 3, 5]) == 5  # Unique after filtering [5] is subsequence

def test_exact_match():
    assert solution([4, 6, 8], [4, 6, 8]) == 2  # Complete overlap

def test_many_possible_subsequences():
    assert solution([10, 12, 10, 12, 14], [12, 10, 14, 10, 12, 14]) == 2  # Unique ordered is [10, 12, 14]

def test_gcd_calculation():
    assert solution([6, 12, 18], [6, 12, 18, 24]) == 6  # GCD of [6, 12, 18] is 6
```
<|Test End|>

This implementation ensures that we properly order the unique profit elements from `profit` and check their presence in `sequence` while correctly calculating the GCD of these elements. The tests are also aligned to validate this behavior accurately.
