QUESTION

Write a Python function to determine if the first half of a given list of integers contains two unique elements, and if both of them have perfect squares as their values.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there was a confusion in the previous attempts due to formatting errors. Let's ensure we provide the correct syntax and structure for the solution and test cases:

### Solution
The solution checks if the first half of a list contains exactly two unique perfect square numbers. 

### Tests
We will ensure that the test cases verify various edge cases, including lists with different sizes and content types.

Let's correct this:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(arr):
    """
    Determines if the first half of the given list 'arr' contains exactly two unique elements,
    and both elements are perfect squares.
    
    :param arr: List of integers
    :return: Boolean value indicating if the conditions are met
    """
    from math import isqrt

    def is_perfect_square(x):
        if x < 0:
            return False
        s = isqrt(x)
        return x == s * s

    if not arr:
        return False

    n = len(arr)
    half = (n + 1) // 2  # Consider the first half including the middle if odd-sized
    first_half_set = set(arr[:half])
    
    if len(first_half_set) != 2:
        return False
    
    return all(is_perfect_square(x) for x in first_half_set)
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_two_unique_perfect_squares():
    assert solution([4, 9, 4, 9, 100]) == True

def test_non_perfect_squares():
    assert solution([3, 3, 3, 5, 7]) == False
    
def test_more_than_two_unique():
    assert solution([1, 4, 9, 16, 25]) == False

def test_less_than_two_unique():
    assert solution([4, 4, 16, 25, 36]) == False

def test_no_elements():
    assert solution([]) == False

def test_negative_values():
    assert solution([-4, -9, -4, -9, 16]) == False

def test_large_perfect_squares():
    assert solution([144, 121, 121, 144, 225]) == True

def test_exact_half_choice():
    assert solution([4, 9, 9, 9]) == True

def test_single_element_half():
    assert solution([4, 16]) == False

def test_odd_size_with_middle_element():
    assert solution([4, 9, 1, 9, 4, 9, 10]) == True  # Only 4, 9 are in the first half
```
<|Test End|>

This corrected structure and content should now properly handle both the problem description and the needed test cases.
