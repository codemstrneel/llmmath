QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a sequence of integers. For each sequence, replace each integer with the first digit of its factorial and check if the resulting sequence forms a Fibonacci sequence. Use recursion to calculate the factorial of the numbers and ensure that the transformation is applied to each sequence using a map function. Return a list of indices of the dictionaries where the sequences fulfill the Fibonacci condition.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's rectify the compilation error found in your previous attempt. It seems like the error is due to incorrect block formatting or mistakenly added characters, most likely in the test setup. I'll modify this to ensure the test and solution are properly formatted and accurate.

Here's the corrected solution and test:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def factorial(n):
    "Recursively calculates the factorial of n."
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

def first_digit_of_factorial(n):
    "Calculates factorial and returns its first digit."
    fact = factorial(n)
    return int(str(fact)[0])

def is_fibonacci_sequence(seq):
    "Checks if a sequence is a Fibonacci sequence."
    if len(seq) < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(seq)):
        if seq[i] != seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2]:
            return False
    return True

def solution(dicts):
    """
    Takes a list of dictionaries each containing a sequence of integers,
    replaces each integer with the first digit of its factorial, 
    and checks if the resulting sequence forms a Fibonacci sequence.

    """
    results = []
    
    for index, d in enumerate(dicts):
        for seq in d.values():
            transformed_seq = list(map(first_digit_of_factorial, seq))
            if is_fibonacci_sequence(transformed_seq):
                results.append(index)
                break
    
    return results
```

        {'seq2': [1, 1, 2, 3]}, # Already Fibonacci
    ]
    assert solution(dicts) == [1]

def test_no_fibonacci_transformed():
    dicts = [
        {'seq1': [6, 7, 4]},   # Transforms to a non-fibonacci sequence
        {'seq2': [2, 9, 3]},   # Transforms to a non-fibonacci sequence
    ]
    assert solution(dicts) == []
```
<|Test End|>

These tests cover different scenarios, such as empty or small sequences, and take into account transformation effects to evaluate whether the sequences are Fibonacci directly or after transforming. The indices reflect the 0-based nature of lists and focus on checking transformation validity.
