QUESTION

New Question:

Write a Python function that processes a URL and an integer `m`. The URL contains a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. The function should perform the following steps:

1. Use regex to extract the year, month, and day from the URL.
2. Calculate the quadratic equation using these values as coefficients: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a \) is the year, \( b \) is the month, and \( c \) is the day.
3. Determine whether the roots of this quadratic equation are integers.
4. If the roots are integers, count the number of vowels in their string representation and store this count.
5. Create a list containing integers from 1 to `m`.
6. Reverse this list up to the position given by the vowel count from step 4. If this count exceeds the length of the list, reverse the entire list.
7. Return the modified list.

### Example:

For the URL `"https://example.com/date/2023-08-15/info"` and `m=10`, the quadratic is \(2023x^2 + 8x + 15 = 0\). The roots are not integers, so no reversal occurs on the list, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

For the URL `"https://example.com/date/1-1-1/info"` and `m=5`, the quadratic is \(1x^2 + 1x + 1 = 0\). The roots are not integers, so no reversal occurs on the list, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Constraints:

1. The URL will always contain a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. Assume that m will not be greater than 1000.
3. Consider the vowel count for both roots if roots are integers.
4. The list consists of integers from 1 to `m`.
