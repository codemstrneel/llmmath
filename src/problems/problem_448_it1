QUESTION

Write a function to generate all possible sublists of a given list and compute the maximum possible product from each sublist of three numbers. Assume the list can contain both positive and negative integers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's fix the code by removing the unnecessary syntax, execute the solution, and make sure all tests are working correctly.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(lst):
    """
    Returns the maximum product of any three numbers from the list, 
    by examining all sublists with exactly three elements.
    """
    if len(lst) < 3:
        raise ValueError("List must contain at least three numbers.")
    
    max_product = float('-inf')
    n = len(lst)
    
    # Check all combinations of three elements
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                product = lst[i] * lst[j] * lst[k]
                if product > max_product:
                    max_product = product
                    
    return max_product
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_basic():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 24
    
def test_solution_with_negatives():
    assert solution([-1, -2, -3, 1, 2, 3]) == 6
    
def test_solution_all_negatives():
    assert solution([-1, -2, -3, -4]) == -6
    
def test_solution_mixed_sign():
    assert solution([-10, -10, 5, 2]) == 500
    
def test_solution_large_numbers():
    assert solution([0, -1, 3, 1000, -1000]) == 3000
    
def test_solution_multiple_same_maximum():
    assert solution([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) == 1

def test_solution_with_zeroes():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 3]) == 6
    assert solution([0, 0, 3, -1, -2]) == 0
    
def test_solution_minimum_length():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3]) == 6

def test_solution_invalid_input():
    try:
        solution([1, 2])  # Less than three numbers
        assert False, "Expected an exception for list with fewer than 3 numbers."
    except ValueError:
        pass
```
<|Test End|>

This should fix the syntax issue present previously, and we can now properly run the provided tests to ensure the functionality works as expected.
