QUESTION

Write a Python function to check whether the first half of a given array contains only one distinct element.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems we still have an issue with the `test_uniform_first_half_even_length`. The current test case fails due to the incorrect expectation in the solution when dealing with even array lengths. Let's address this and ensure consistent behavior. Specifically, we aim to test if the first half of the array contains a single distinct element.

In the given implementation, the logic is correct: for an array of even length, you look at the first half and check if all elements are the same. There might be an issue in the test case itself. Let's refine the test expectations accordingly:

1. For an even-length array, we should verify the first half, and if the test case is looking for uniformity, it should consider the elements contributing to half.

Here's the refined solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(arr):
    """
    Determines if the first half of the input array contains only one distinct element.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (list): The list of elements to check.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the first half of the array contains only one distinct element, False otherwise.
    """
    # Calculate the midpoint of the array
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    
    # Get the first half of the array
    first_half = arr[:mid]
    
    # Check if all elements in the first half are the same
    if len(first_half) > 0:
        return all(element == first_half[0] for element in first_half)
    
    return False
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_empty_array():
    assert solution([]) == False

def test_single_element_array():
    assert solution([1]) == False  # technically no half, resolve to False

def test_two_element_array():
    assert solution([1, 2]) == True  # the first half has only one element

def test_uniform_first_half():
    assert solution([1, 1, 2, 3]) == True

def test_non_uniform_first_half():
    assert solution([1, 2, 1, 3]) == False

def test_full_uniform_array():
    assert solution([4, 4, 4, 4]) == True

def test_partial_arrays():
    assert solution([3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3]) == True
    assert solution([6, 6, 4, 5, 6, 6]) == False

def test_uniform_first_half_even_length():
    # The first half [5, 5, 7, 7] contains distinct elements, hence False
    assert solution([5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11]) == False

def test_non_uniform_first_half_even_length():
    assert solution([5, 6, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11]) == False

def test_only_one_element_in_even_length_odd_first_half():
    assert solution([7, 8]) == True  # single element in first half
<|Test End|>

These adjustments ensure accurate coverage and align expectations with the solution's logic when checking halves of arrays.
