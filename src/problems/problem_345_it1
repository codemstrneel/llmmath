QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of dictionaries, an integer n, and a sorted array with one extra element compared to another sorted array. The function should perform the following tasks: 

1. Calculate the nth Fibonacci number and use it as a key to sort the list of dictionaries. 
2. Identify and return the index of the extra element in the first array. 
3. Check if any of the sequences contained in the dictionaries, once mapped through a transformation where each integer is replaced by the first digit of its factorial, forms a Fibonacci sequence.

Combine these functionalities and return a tuple containing the sorted list of dictionaries, the index of the extra element, and a list of indices of the dictionaries that match the Fibonacci condition. Use recursion where necessary and apply a map function to transform the sequences.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Thank you for providing the detailed task and output log. Based on your description, it appears that the solution function needs adjustment in both logic and tests, especially in correctly identifying the Fibonacci sequences and computing the nth Fibonacci number correctly. Let's address these issues.

1. **Fibonacci Calculation:** The original nth_fibonacci function uses a naive recursive approach, which is inefficient for larger n and may lead to incorrect results due to stack overflow. We will switch to an iterative method.

2. **Fibonacci Sequence Check:** It seems there might be a misunderstanding with the transformed sequence and checks for a Fibonacci sequence. We need to ensure that the Fibonacci check is correct after mapping each integer to the first digit of its factorial.

3. **Sorting dictionaries by a key related to Fibonacci:** The dictionaries are expected to be sorted based on a key derived from Fibonacci numbers, which was abstract in the initial attempt. A clearer requirement or interpretation might be necessary here.

Let's refine the solution and provide updated test cases.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Iterative approach to avoid recursion depth issues
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n+1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

def find_extra_element_index(arr1, arr2):
    # arr1 has one extra element than arr2
    for index in range(len(arr2)):
        if arr1[index] != arr2[index]:
            return index
    return len(arr1) - 1

def first_digit_of_factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return int(str(factorial)[0])

def is_fibonacci_sequence(seq):
    if len(seq) < 3:
        return False
    a, b = seq[0], seq[1]
    for num in seq[2:]:
        if a + b != num:
            return False
        a, b = b, num
    return True

def solution(dictionaries, n, arr1, arr2):
    # Calculate the nth Fibonacci number (used in sorting logic)
    fib_number = nth_fibonacci(n)
    
    # Sort dictionaries by nth Fibonacci number used as key, falling back to 0 if no such key
    sorted_dicts = sorted(dictionaries, key=lambda d: d.get(fib_number, 0))
    
    # Find the extra element index in arr1
    extra_index = find_extra_element_index(arr1, arr2)
    
    # Identify dictionaries with sequences that transform to a Fibonacci sequence
    fib_seq_indices = []
    for idx, d in enumerate(sorted_dicts):
        if 'sequence' in d:
            transformed_sequence = list(map(first_digit_of_factorial, d['sequence']))
            if is_fibonacci_sequence(transformed_sequence):
                fib_seq_indices.append(idx)
    
    return (sorted_dicts, extra_index, fib_seq_indices)
<|Solution End|>
```

Here are the revised test cases that should correctly verify the solution:

```python

    dicts = [{'sequence': [5, 7, 12]}, {'sequence': [1, 1, 2, 3]}, {'sequence': [4, 6, 10]}]

    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    arr2 = [1, 2, 4, 5]
    expected = (
        [{'sequence': [1, 1, 2, 3]}, {'sequence': [5, 7, 12]}, {'sequence': [4, 6, 10]}],
        2,
        [0]
    )
    assert solution(dicts, n, arr1, arr2) == expected

def test_solution_no_fibonacci_in_list():
    dicts = [{'sequence': [7, 8, 15]}, {'sequence': [9, 9, 18]}, {'sequence': [11, 14, 25]}]
    n = 3  # Fib(3) = 2
    arr1 = [5, 9, 13]
    arr2 = [5, 13]
    expected = (
        [{'sequence': [7, 8, 15]}, {'sequence': [9, 9, 18]}, {'sequence': [11, 14, 25]}],
        1,
        []
    )
    assert solution(dicts, n, arr1, arr2) == expected

def test_solution_extra_element_at_end():
    dicts = [{'sequence': [13, 21, 34]}, {'sequence': [8, 13, 21]}]
    n = 4  # Fib(4) = 3
    arr1 = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
    arr2 = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
    expected = (
        [{'sequence': [8, 13, 21]}, {'sequence': [13, 21, 34]}],
        5,
        [0, 1]
    )
    assert solution(dicts, n, arr1, arr2) == expected

    dicts = [{'data': [1, 2, 3]}, {'data': [2, 3, 5]}]
    n = 6  # Fib(6) = 8
    arr1 = [7, 11, 13]
    arr2 = [7, 11]
    expected = (
        [{'data': [1, 2, 3]}, {'data': [2, 3, 5]}],
        2,
        []
    )
    assert solution(dicts, n, arr1, arr2) == expected

def test_factorial_single_digit():
    dicts = [{'sequence': [1, 2]}, {'sequence': [2, 3]}, {'sequence': [3, 5]}]
    n = 2  # Fib(2) = 1
    arr1 = [1, 4, 5, 6]
    arr2 = [1, 5, 6]
    expected = (
        [{'sequence': [1, 2]}, {'sequence': [2, 3]}, {'sequence': [3, 5]}],
        1,
        []
    )
    assert solution(dicts, n, arr1, arr2) == expected
<|Test End|>
