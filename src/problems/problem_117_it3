QUESTION

Write a function that accepts a complex data structure consisting of a list of sublists, where each sublist contains both integers and strings. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each sublist, identify the first three integers and check if they form a valid triangle. If they form a valid triangle and the sum of these integers is even, calculate the product of the integers. Sum this product for all valid triangles.

2. Within the same sublist, scan each string for numeric values. Adjust each numeric value by a given integer from a tuple. Then, calculate the average of the new lengths of these strings. If this average exceeds the second integer in the tuple, exclude that sublist from further processing.

3. Provide a return value that is a dictionary containing:
   - "triangle_products": the accumulated sum of the products of valid triangle integers.
   - "num_remaining_sublists": the count of sublists that passed the string length check after numeric adjustment.

Ensure all numerical operations handle edge cases such as negative integers gracefully, and assume sublists with fewer than three integers are ignored for the triangle check.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems that in the last attempt, I mistakenly included the solution code within triple backticks, which is not the right format for our expected output. The correct format is to remove these backticks. Let's correct this mistake.

Here's the refined solution and the accompanying test cases:

This should properly handle the solution and test cases without formatting issues.
