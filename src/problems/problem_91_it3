QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of integers and a number representing the number of left rotations to perform on this list. After performing the rotations, compute the maximum number among the sum of squares of the integers in the rotated list and return its position in the list. If there is more than one such number, return the position of the rightmost occurrence.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the inconsistency in understanding the problem correctly, it's essential to ensure that the solution finds the position of the rightmost number that results in the highest value when squared. This involves implementing the rotations and finding the maximum squared value location accurately.

Below is the corrected solution along with the revised tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(arr, rotations):
    """
    Rotates the list 'arr' to the left by 'rotations' places and returns 
    the position of the rightmost element that has the maximum squared value itself.
    """
    if not arr:
        return -1  # return -1 if the list is empty
    
    n = len(arr)
    # Adjust the rotations in case it exceeds the length of the array
    rotations = rotations % n
    
    # Perform the left rotations
    rotated = arr[rotations:] + arr[:rotations]
    
    # Find the rightmost position of the element with the maximum square value
    max_square_value = float('-inf')
    rightmost_position = -1
    
    for i, num in enumerate(rotated):
        square_value = num ** 2
        if square_value > max_square_value or (square_value == max_square_value and i > rightmost_position):
            max_square_value = square_value
            rightmost_position = i
    
    return rightmost_position

def test_solution_example():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == 2  # [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]; max square 25 at position 2

def test_solution_single_element():
    assert solution([10], 3) == 0  # Only one element

def test_solution_two_elements():
    assert solution([5, 7], 1) == 0  # [7, 5]; max square 49 at position 0

def test_empty_array():
    assert solution([], 5) == -1  # Empty list

def test_no_rotation():
    assert solution([2, 4, 1], 0) == 1  # [2, 4, 1]; max square 16 at position 1

def test_solution_all_zeros():
    assert solution([0, 0, 0], 5) == 2  # All same, rightmost index 2

def test_solution_large_rotations():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 10) == 2  # Effective rotation is 10 % 3 = 1, max square 9 at position 2

def test_solution_negatives():
    assert solution([-3, -2, -6, -1], 3) == 0  # [-1, -3, -2, -6]; rightmost max square at position 0 with value -1 squared as 1

def test_solution_repeated_max_squares():
    assert solution([1, 2, 2, 3, 3], 2) == 4  # [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]; rightmost max square (3^2=9) at position 4

<|Test End|>

These updates should handle the positional computations accurately, correctly reflecting the rightmost occurrence in the presence of repeated highest squared values.
