QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of dictionaries where each dictionary has numeric values and a pair of integer coordinates representing two points in a coordinate plane. The function should perform the following steps:

1. Sort the list of dictionaries based on a specified numeric field using a lambda function.
2. Calculate the slope of the line formed by the given pair of integer coordinates.
3. Traverse the sorted dictionary list and identify all dictionaries where the specified numeric field value is greater than the calculated slope.
4. Return a new list of dictionaries containing only those that meet the criteria, along with a count of how many dictionaries were filtered out.

This question combines the concepts of sorting using lambda functions, calculating the slope between two points, and filtering a list of dictionaries based on a calculated threshold.
