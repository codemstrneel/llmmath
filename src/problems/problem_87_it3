QUESTION

Write a function that cyclically shifts each string in a given list to the left by a specified number of characters. After shifting each string, use regex to check if any specific substring is present in any of the shifted strings and return a list of booleans indicating the presence or absence of the substring in each shifted string.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues step by step by ensuring the syntax is correct and the tests are aligned with the expected outputs of cyclically shifted strings. The previous errors were due to incorrect expectations from the shifted strings in the tests. I will fix these errors and format the code correctly without unnecessary tick marks inside code blocks.

Here's the corrected solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import re

def solution(strings, shift, substring):
    """
    Cyclically shifts each string in the list to the left by the specified number 
    of characters and checks for the presence of a given substring using regex.

    Parameters:
    strings (List[str]): List of strings to be shifted.
    shift (int): Number of characters to shift each string to the left.
    substring (str): The substring to check for using regex.

    Returns:
    List[bool]: A list of booleans indicating presence (True) or absence (False)
                of the substring in each shifted string.
    """
    def shift_string(s, n):
        if not s:
            return s
        n = n % len(s)  # handle shift values larger than the string length
        return s[n:] + s[:n]

    result = []
    pattern = re.compile(substring)
    for s in strings:
        shifted = shift_string(s, shift)
        if pattern.search(shifted):
            result.append(True)
        else:
            result.append(False)
    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_no_shift():
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 0, "lo") == [True, False]

def test_solution_basic_shift():
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 2, "low") == [True, False]

def test_solution_large_shift():
    assert solution(["test", "example"], 10, "ex") == [False, True]

def test_solution_no_substring_found():
    assert solution(["python", "java"], 3, "xyz") == [False, False]

def test_solution_empty_strings():
    assert solution(["", ""], 1, "a") == [False, False]

def test_solution_shift_equals_length():
    assert solution(["shift", "string"], len("shift"), "sh") == [True, False]

def test_solution_regexp_special_characters():
    assert solution(["regex-101", "test*"], 4, "ex-101") == [True, False]

def test_solution_all_matching():
    assert solution(["match", "maybe"], 1, "atch") == [True, False]
```
<|Test End|>

I've corrected the test expectations by ensuring the assertions are based on the correctly shifted strings. This should ensure that the test checks logically align with the solution's operations.
