QUESTION

Write a function that takes a binary tree and returns a tuple containing two values: the number of leaf nodes in the tree, and the second smallest Fibonacci number corresponding to the heights of those leaf nodes. If there is no second smallest number, return `None` for that part of the tuple. Calculate Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

SOLUTION/TESTS

There seems to be an issue with the `test_two_levels_tree` test case as it failed during execution. Let's ensure our logic aligns with the properties of this problem, particularly in Fibonacci number calculations and determining the second smallest number correctly. 

I'll review the solution and make necessary adjustments both there and in the tests.

### Solution and Tests

The original solution seems logically correct for many setups, but let's focus on refining the edge cases, particularly scenarios where heights may result in multiple Fibonacci calculations.

**Solution Refinement**

I will verify if the Fibonacci calculation matches expectations and ensure we handle leaf counting and Fibonacci number extraction properly.

**Tests Refinement**

I'll adjust the tests for accuracy regarding leaf heights and Fibonacci outputs. Let's present the corrected version below.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number recursively.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

def solution(root):
    """
    Returns a tuple with the number of leaf nodes in the tree and the second smallest
    Fibonacci number corresponding to the heights of those leaf nodes.
    """
    if not root:
        return (0, None)

    leaf_heights = []

    def dfs(node, height):
        if node:
            # If it's a leaf node
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                leaf_heights.append(height)
            dfs(node.left, height + 1)
            dfs(node.right, height + 1)

    dfs(root, 0)

    # Calculate Fibonacci numbers for unique heights
    fibonacci_numbers = set(fibonacci(h) for h in set(leaf_heights))

    # If there's a second smallest, return it, otherwise None
    if len(fibonacci_numbers) > 1:
        return (len(leaf_heights), sorted(fibonacci_numbers)[1])
    else:
        return (len(leaf_heights), None)
<|Solution End|>
```

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution, TreeNode

def test_single_node_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    assert solution(root) == (1, None)

def test_two_levels_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3))
    assert solution(root) == (2, None)  # Heights are 1, 1 and Fibonacci for 1 is 1. No second smallest

def test_complex_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1,
                    TreeNode(2,
                             TreeNode(4),
                             TreeNode(5, TreeNode(8))),
                    TreeNode(3,
                             TreeNode(6, None, TreeNode(9)),
                             TreeNode(7)))
    assert solution(root) == (4, 2)  # Leaf heights are 2, 3, 3, 3; Fibonacci numbers are 1, 2.

def test_tree_with_multiple_fibonacci():
    root = TreeNode(1,
                    TreeNode(2,
                             TreeNode(4),
                             TreeNode(5, TreeNode(8), TreeNode(9))),
                    TreeNode(3,
                             TreeNode(6),
                             TreeNode(7)))
    assert solution(root) == (5, 2)  # Leaf heights are 2, 3, 3, 3, 2; Fibonacci numbers 1, 2.

def test_no_leaves():
    assert solution(None) == (0, None)
<|Test End|>
```

### Explanation of the Refinements

- Corrected `test_two_levels_tree` to reflect a scenario where no second smallest Fibonacci number exists due to identical leaf heights.
- The solution remains unchanged since the logic handles leaf node detection and Fibonacci number retrieval accurately.
- Test cases validate the Fibonacci calculation intricacies and ensure the function handles trees of varying structures and complexities.
