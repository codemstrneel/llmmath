QUESTION

Here's a novel question that combines the core concepts from some of your provided questions:

---

**Question 6:**

Write a Python function that processes a list of strings and an integer \( k \) to transform and analyze them through the following stages:

1. **Character Rotation Stage:** For each string, perform a left rotation on its characters by a number derived from the sum of its digits (e.g., if a string "ab3c5" sums its digits to 8, rotate it 8 positions to the left).

2. **String Evaluation Stage:** Evaluate each rotated string to count the number of alphabets, digits, and special characters it contains.

3. **Position Insertion Stage:** For each evaluated string, determine its insertion index if the strings were to be sorted in ascending order based on the alphabet count.

4. **Subgroup Formation and Modification Stage:** Divide the evaluated strings into subgroups of size \( k \). Within each subgroup, reverse each string that has more digits than alphabetic characters.

5. **Final Output Construction:** For each subgroup, create a tuple containing:
   - The count of strings in the subgroup.
   - The list of strings sorted by their original insertion index.

Examples:
- Given the list `["abc123!", "0j9k2l", "1a2b3c!", "*9n!"]` with \( k = 2 \), the function processes the list through each stage to provide the final output.
- For the strings `["z2y3x!", "m5n4", "13pqr", "@w1#"]` with \( k = 3 \), follow the stages to produce the result.

This question combines concepts of string manipulation, character counting, positional indexing, and subgroup processing with conditions.

This new question introduces additional complexity by blending character rotation, counting, insertion indexing, and subgroup processing concepts in innovative ways.
