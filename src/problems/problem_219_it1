QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of integers and a list of strings, as well as a dictionary mapping Roman numeral strings to integers. The function should perform the following steps:

1. For the integer list: Check whether every element at an even index is both positive and a prime number. If all conditions are satisfied, set a flag to `True`, otherwise set it to `False`.

2. For the strings list: Rotate the list to the right by a number of positions equal to the count of prime numbers at even indices in the integer list. After rotating, interpret the strings at even indices as Roman numerals using the provided dictionary. Calculate the sum of these interpreted numbers, considering any invalid Roman numeral as zero.

The function should return a tuple with the first element as the boolean flag indicating whether the integer list condition was met, and the second element as the calculated sum from the string list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's revise the solution and tests based on the feedback that all tests failed. It seems that there might be an issue either with the functionality of the code logic or the test cases. Let's carefully review and correct them.

### Correct Solution
First, we'll ensure that the logic for processing the integer and string lists aligns correctly with the problem statement. Then we'll revisit the unit tests to ensure they are correctly formed and validate the function accurately.

Notice that the step of validating all even-indexed integers for positive and prime status wasn't thoroughly checked. Also, the Roman numeral map and rotated string positions need to match with the correct sum calculations.

### Solution and Test Code

#### Solution Code
```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(integers, strings, roman_to_int):
    """
    Evaluates a list of integers and a list of strings based on specified conditions.
    """
    def is_prime(n):
        """Determine if a number is prime."""
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    # Step 1: Check every element at even index in the integer list
    all_primes_on_even_indices = True
    prime_count = 0
    for i in range(0, len(integers), 2):
        if integers[i] <= 0 or not is_prime(integers[i]):
            all_primes_on_even_indices = False
        else:
            prime_count += 1

    # Step 2: Rotate the list of strings and calculate sum based on Roman numerals
    def rotate_right(lst, positions):
        """Rotate a list to the right by the given number of positions."""
        if not lst:
            return lst
        positions = positions % len(lst)
        return lst[-positions:] + lst[:-positions]

    rotated_strings = rotate_right(strings, prime_count)
    roman_sum = 0
    for i in range(0, len(rotated_strings), 2):
        roman_value = roman_to_int.get(rotated_strings[i], 0)
        roman_sum += roman_value

    return (all_primes_on_even_indices, roman_sum)
<|Solution End|>
```

#### Unit Test Code
```python
<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_integer_list_all_prime():
    integers = [2, 3, 5, 8, 11]
    strings = ['I', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'V']
    roman_to_int = {'I': 1, 'II': 2, 'III': 3, 'IV': 4, 'V': 5}
    assert solution(integers, strings, roman_to_int) == (True, 6)

def test_solution_integer_list_not_all_prime():
    integers = [4, 3, 5, 8, 11]
    strings = ['I', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'V']
    roman_to_int = {'I': 1, 'II': 2, 'III': 3, 'IV': 4, 'V': 5}
    assert solution(integers, strings, roman_to_int) == (False, 6)

def test_solution_no_prime_integers():
    integers = [-1, 0, 1, 4, 6]
    strings = ['IX', 'IV', 'VII', 'XX', 'XX']
    roman_to_int = {'I': 1, 'IV': 4, 'IX': 9, 'VII': 7, 'XX': 20}
    assert solution(integers, strings, roman_to_int) == (False, 13)

def test_solution_all_invalid_roman_numerals():
    integers = [2, 4, 3, 5, 7]
    strings = ['X', 'Y', 'Z']
    roman_to_int = {'A': 10, 'B': 20}
    assert solution(integers, strings, roman_to_int) == (False, 0)

def test_solution_no_string_rotation_needed():
    integers = [2, 4, 3, 5, 7]
    strings = ['IV', 'IX', 'VII']
    roman_to_int = {'IV': 4, 'VII': 7, 'IX': 9}
    assert solution(integers, strings, roman_to_int) == (True, 13)
