QUESTION

Write a Python function to determine how many values of \( x \) satisfy a given cubic equation within a specified integer range. The cubic equation will be provided in the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \), with integer coefficients \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). The range will also be specified with integer boundaries, \( \text{low} \) and \( \text{high} \), inclusive. Your function should count how many integer solutions exist within this range and return that count.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears there are some test cases that have failed. Upon analyzing the test cases, it looks like there are logical issues in a few of these tests. I'll correct them and ensure they accurately test the solution.

Let's address the issues:

1. **test_solution_two_solutions**: This test had an incorrect equation setup that wouldn't necessarily have two solutions. I'll fix this with a proper cubic equation that has two integer solutions.

Here is the corrected solution and test suite:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(a, b, c, d, low, high):
    """
    Determines how many integer values of x satisfy the cubic equation
    ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 within the range [low, high].

    Parameters:
    - a, b, c, d: coefficients of the cubic equation.
    - low, high: the range in which to look for integer solutions.

    Returns:
    - The count of integer values of x that satisfy the equation within the range.
    """
    count = 0
    for x in range(low, high + 1):
        if a * x**3 + b * x**2 + c * x + d == 0:
            count += 1
    return count
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_solution_no_solution():
    assert solution(1, 0, 0, 1, -10, 10) == 0

def test_solution_one_solution():
    assert solution(1, -3, 3, -1, -10, 10) == 1  # (x-1)^3, solution x = 1

def test_solution_two_solutions():
    assert solution(1, 0, -1, 0, -10, 10) == 2  # x(x^2 - 1) = 0, solutions x = -1, 0, 1, but 0 and 1 are in range

def test_solution_three_solutions():
    assert solution(1, -6, 11, -6, -10, 10) == 3  # (x-1)(x-2)(x-3), solutions are x = 1, 2, 3

def test_solution_no_solution_out_of_range():
    assert solution(1, -6, 11, -6, 4, 10) == 0  # Solutions are 1, 2, 3 which are out of range [4, 10]

def test_solution_large_range():
    assert solution(1, 0, 0, 0, -10, 10) == 1  # (x^3 = 0), solution x = 0

def test_solution_negative_range():
    assert solution(1, 0, 0, 0, -10, -1) == 0  # (x^3 = 0), no solution in negative range

<|Test End|>

With these changes, the solution implementation and test cases are more accurately aligned to validate a cubic equation's solutions within a given integer range.
