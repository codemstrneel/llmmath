Create a Python function that calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given non-negative integer.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given non-negative integer \( n \). The binomial coefficients for a given \( n \) are the coefficients of the polynomial expansion of \((1+x)^n\). The sum of these coefficients is always \( 2^n \).

Here's our solution:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n):
    """
    Returns the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given non-negative integer n.
    This sum is equal to 2^n.
    """
    return 2 ** n
```
<|Solution End|>

Now, let's write some unit tests to ensure the solution works correctly.

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution():
    # Test with n = 0; the sum should be 2^0 = 1
    assert solution(0) == 1
    
    # Test with n = 1; the sum should be 2^1 = 2
    assert solution(1) == 2
    
    # Test with n = 2; the sum should be 2^2 = 4
    assert solution(2) == 4
    
    # Test with n = 3; the sum should be 2^3 = 8
    assert solution(3) == 8

    # Test with n = 10; the sum should be 2^10 = 1024
    assert solution(10) == 1024
    
    # Test with a larger n, like n = 20; the sum should be 2^20 = 1048576
    assert solution(20) == 1048576
    
    # Test an edge case with a maximum reasonable value of n
    # If the environment supports large integers, we could test something large
    # assert solution(100) == 2**100
```
<|Test End|>

These tests cover a variety of scenarios, from edge cases to typical uses, ensuring robust validation of the function. Each test checks the solution against the mathematical formula \( 2^n \).
