QUESTION

Write a function that rotates a single list by a specified number of items to the left, then checks if there is any element whose rightmost set bit matches the rightmost set bit of any other element in the rotated list. If such elements exist, return the sum of their indices in the original list. If no such elements exist, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the description from the Task and the previous attempt's issues, I will now correct the solution and refine the unit tests to ensure accuracy.

### Problem Analysis
The function's task is to:
1. Rotate a list by `k` positions to the left.
2. Check for elements in the rotated list that have the same rightmost set bit.
3. If such elements exist, sum their original indices; otherwise, return -1.

### Solution Correction
I'll first address the functionality and logic issues in the previous solution and use these insights to fix the solution. 

#### Key Points:
- **Rightmost Set Bit:** The calculation should compare powers of two directly.
- **Summation of Indices:** Ensure we deal correctly with matching bits.
  
### Adjusted Solution
```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(lst, k):
    """
    Rotates the list to the left by k elements and finds if there is any element 
    whose rightmost set bit matches the rightmost set bit of any other element 
    in the rotated list. If such elements exist, returns the sum of their 
    indices in the original list. If no such elements exist, returns -1.
    """
    if not lst:
        return -1
    
    # Rotate list to the left by k
    n = len(lst)
    rotated = lst[k % n:] + lst[:k % n]
    
    def rightmost_set_bit(x):
        # Returns the value of the rightmost set bit of x (as a power of two)
        return x & -x
    
    # Dictionary to store the sum of indices for each bit pattern
    bit_to_original_indices = {}
    
    # Check each number in the rotated list
    for original_index, num in enumerate(lst):
        r_bit = rightmost_set_bit(num)
        if r_bit in bit_to_original_indices:
            if original_index != bit_to_original_indices[r_bit]:
                return bit_to_original_indices[r_bit] + original_index
        else:
            bit_to_original_indices[r_bit] = original_index
    
    return -1
<|Solution End|>
```

### Unit Tests Revision
Adjusting tests to focus more on the key functional aspects and avoid previous logical errors.
```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_single_rotation_with_match():
    assert solution([2, 4, 8], 1) == 1  # Indices 0 and 1 match in rightmost set bit

def test_single_rotation_no_match():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 1) == -1

def test_full_rotation_with_match():
    assert solution([2, 5, 10], 3) == 1  # Indices 1 and 2 match

def test_full_rotation_no_match():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) == -1

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 3) == -1

def test_single_element():
    assert solution([10], 0) == -1
    assert solution([10], 1) == -1

def test_large_k_value():
    assert solution([10, 15, 20, 25], 1000) == -1

def test_elements_with_same_rightmost_bit():
    assert solution([16, 8, 4, 2], 2) == 5  # Indices 2 and 3 match

def test_match_at_end_of_rotation():
    assert solution([4, 8, 16, 32], 2) == 2  # Indices 0 and 2 (4, 16) match
<|Test End|>
```

These corrections and adjustments should address previous errors and align the solution behavior with the task definition.
