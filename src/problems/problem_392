QUESTION

Certainly! Here's a new question that combines core concepts from your provided questions, specifically drawing on elements of pairwise operations, lambda functions, and handling lists and tuples.

---

**New Question:**

Create a function that takes two inputs: a list of tuples and an integer `m`. Each tuple consists of two numeric elements. 

1. **Tuple Comparison and Operation**:
   - For each tuple `(a, b)`, if both `a` and `b` are positive, compute the product `a * b`.
   - If either `a` or `b` is negative, compute `abs(a - b)`.
   - If both are zero, return zero for that tuple after performing the operations.
   
2. **Enhancement with Scalar Multiplication**:
   - Multiply each resulting value by the integer `m` using a lambda function and map.
   
3. **Output**:
   - Return a list of integers, where each element represents the computed and scaled value for each tuple.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure that all elements in tuples are numeric. Raise a `ValueError` if any non-numeric element is found.

For example, given the list of tuples `[(5, 3), (-1, 4), (7, 0), (0, 0)]` and `m = 3`:
- For the first tuple `(5, 3)`, both elements are positive, so output `5 * 3 = 15`.
- For the second tuple `(-1, 4)`, one element is negative, so output `abs(-1 - 4) = 5`.
- For the third tuple `(7, 0)`, one is zero, so output `abs(7 - 0) = 7`.
- For the fourth tuple `(0, 0)`, both are zero, so output `0`.

After applying the scalar multiplication (scaling by `m = 3`), return the list `[45, 15, 21, 0]`.

The function should efficiently handle large lists using functional programming concepts such as map and lambda functions.

This question combines the tuple operations from Question 4 and the list transformation elements from Questions 1 and 2.
