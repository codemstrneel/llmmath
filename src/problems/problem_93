QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that combines geometric calculations with numerical analysis and string pattern recognition. The function should take three inputs: a float radius, a list of integers, and a string containing a sequence of mathematical expressions.

The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **Calculate the Arc Lengths:** For angles in degrees expressed as integers in the list, calculate the arc length of each angle on a circle with the given radius. Return these arc lengths in a list, only if they are even numbers, using the formula: \(\text{Arc Length} = \frac{\text{angle} \times \pi \times \text{radius}}{180}\).

2. **Identify Numeric Patterns:** For the integers where the resulting arc lengths are even, find subsequences where the difference between consecutive numbers is exactly 3. Return all such subsequences.

3. **String Pattern Recognition:** In the input string, identify and return any substrings where a series of digits is enclosed within balanced parentheses. Use regular expressions to find these patterns.

The function should return a tuple containing:
- A list of arc lengths (rounded to two decimal places) that are even.
- A list of subsequences of integers where consecutive elements differ by 3.
- A list of all substrings in the input string that are numbers enclosed in balanced parentheses.

This novel question requires you to intertwine geometric calculations, numeric pattern detection, and string pattern recognition to create a multifaceted solution.
