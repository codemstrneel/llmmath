QUESTION

**New Combined Question:**

Create a Python function that simultaneously processes both string and numerical data, integrating different transformation and analysis techniques. The function should draw on elements from your provided questions in a novel way:

1. **Tuple Transformation & Analysis:**
   - Take a list of tuples, each containing text strings and floating-point numbers.
   - Construct a new list of tuples by:
     - Discarding any tuples where the floating-point number is not strictly greater than 1.
     - For the remaining tuples, normalize each string by removing any sequence of consecutive identical letters and transforming them to lowercase.

2. **String and Pattern Replacement:**
   - Accept an additional input string. Replace any sequence of digits with the placeholder "**NUM**" using regular expressions.
   - Determine if the modified string starts with a pattern defined by a given substring, ignoring case sensitivity.

3. **Numerical Analysis and Sequence Detection:**
   - Extract all floating-point numbers from the initial list of tuples and compute their sum after rounding each to the nearest whole number.
   - Analyze the sequence of rounded numbers for any subsequence of consecutive numbers. Capture both these subsequences and their lengths.
   - Generate a dictionary logging each pair of consecutive numbers' differences within these subsequences.

The function should return a tuple with four elements:

- The new list of normalized tuples after filtering and transformation.
- The modified string with digit sequences replaced.
- A boolean indicating whether this transformed string begins with the substring pattern.
- A dictionary containing two keys: `"rounded_sum"`, the sum of all rounded floating-point numbers, and `"consecutive_differences"`, showing the differences between two consecutive numbers in each identified subsequence.

**Function Signature:**

```python
def process_and_analyze_data(tuples_list, input_string, substring):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```

This function combines text normalization, regex application, floating-point number rounding, and analysis of numerical sequences, integrating a broader spectrum of operations across strings and numbers than seen in individual previous questions.
