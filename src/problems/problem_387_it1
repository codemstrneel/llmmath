QUESTION

Write a function that finds the top k unique lists from a given list of lists, based on the minimum sum of elements within each list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The provided solution and tests include syntax errors due to incorrect use of code blocks. Let's provide a correct solution and test suite according to the specified format.

### Solution and Test Plan

The solution involves:
1. Finding unique lists based on their content.
2. Sorting these unique lists by the sum of their elements.
3. Returning the top `k` lists with the smallest sums.

Let's implement the solution and write unit tests to cover different edge cases.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(list_of_lists, k):
    # Normalize lists as tuples for uniqueness
    unique_lists = list(map(list, {tuple(lst) for lst in list_of_lists}))
    
    # Sort the unique lists by the sum of their elements
    sorted_unique_lists = sorted(unique_lists, key=lambda x: sum(x))
    
    # Return the top k lists with the smallest sums
    return sorted_unique_lists[:k]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_with_unique_lists():
    assert solution([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3]], 2) == [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

def test_solution_with_repeated_lists():
    assert solution([[1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], 1) == [[1, 2]]

def test_solution_more_k_than_lists():
    assert solution([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 6]], 5) == [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 6]]

def test_solution_with_negative_numbers():
    assert solution([[1, -2, 3], [-1, 2, -3], [0, 0, 0]], 3) == [[-1, 2, -3], [0, 0, 0], [1, -2, 3]]

def test_solution_varied_lengths():
    assert solution([[3], [1, 2], [2, 1, 0]], 2) == [[1, 2], [2, 1, 0]]

def test_solution_k_zero():
    assert solution([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0) == []

def test_solution_single_list():
    assert solution([[5, 5]], 1) == [[5, 5]]
```
<|Test End|>

These tests will ensure that:
- The function correctly handles duplicate lists.
- It sorts lists by their sum, even when negative numbers are present.
- It behaves correctly when `k` is zero or larger than the number of unique lists.
- It processes lists of varying lengths and content.
