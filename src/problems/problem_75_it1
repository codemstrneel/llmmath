QUESTION

Write a function that, given two lists of lists of equal dimensions, performs an element-wise multiplication of the two matrices. The resulting matrix should then have each row reordered so that all odd numbers appear before even numbers. Finally, the function should calculate and return the sum of the elements in a specified column from this reordered matrix.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's review the initial goal and make adjustments to ensure the solution functions as intended. The solution aims to perform element-wise multiplication of two matrices, reorder each row to have odd numbers first, then return the sum of a specified column. We'll update the solution and the tests accordingly.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Element-wise Multiplication:** Each corresponding element in the matrices should multiply.
2. **Row Reordering:** Each row should be reordered to bring odd numbers first.
3. **Column Sum:** Sum the specified column considering the reordered rows.

### Fixes Needed:

- **Initial Incorrect Assumptions in Test Cases:** 
  Some test cases did not align with expected behavior according to the problem description.
  
- **Adjust Test Logic:** Ensure that the test expectations correctly check for valid transformations and indexing.

Let's fix and verify the solution code with corrected tests:

    """

    and returns the sum of the elements in a specified column.

    if not matrix1 or not matrix2:
        return 0

    # Perform element-wise multiplication.

    for row1, row2 in zip(matrix1, matrix2):
        multiplied_row = [x * y for x, y in zip(row1, row2)]
        multiplied_matrix.append(multiplied_row)

    # Reorder each row so that odd numbers come before even numbers
    reordered_matrix = []
    for row in multiplied_matrix:
        odd_numbers = [x for x in row if x % 2 != 0]
        even_numbers = [x for x in row if x % 2 == 0]
        reordered_row = odd_numbers + even_numbers
        reordered_matrix.append(reordered_row)

    # Calculate the sum of the elements in the specified column
    column_sum = 0
    for row in reordered_matrix:
        if column_index < len(row):  # Ensure the column index is valid
            column_sum += row[column_index]

    return column_sum
