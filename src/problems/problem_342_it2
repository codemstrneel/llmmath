QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a sorted list where one element is an extra and a single integer representing the target index of a factorial number. The function should return a tuple containing two values: the index of the extra element in the list and the first digit of the factorial of the given integer. Combine iterative and recursive approaches in your solution.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. It seems there was a syntax issue with the code blocks, which I've corrected below. Let's ensure that the solution is correct and test cases correspond accurately to the requirements.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(sorted_list, target):
    # Find the index of the extra element in the sorted list
    def find_extra_element_index(sorted_list):
        for i in range(len(sorted_list) - 1):
            if sorted_list[i + 1] != sorted_list[i] + 1:
                return i + 1
        return len(sorted_list) - 1  # In case the extra element is at the end
    
    # Recursive function to calculate factorial
    def factorial_recursive(n):
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
    
    # Calculate the first digit of factorial number
    def first_digit_of_factorial(n):
        fact = factorial_recursive(n)
        return int(str(fact)[0])
    
    extra_element_index = find_extra_element_index(sorted_list)
    first_digit = first_digit_of_factorial(target)
    
    return (extra_element_index, first_digit)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_extra_in_middle():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6], 5) == (3, 1), "Failed on test with extra in the middle"

def test_solution_extra_at_start():
    assert solution([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 4) == (1, 2), "Failed on test with extra at start"

def test_solution_extra_at_end():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8], 3) == (7, 6), "Failed on test with extra at end"

def test_solution_extra_in_large_list():
    # Large list test with extra element at the end
    assert solution(list(range(100)) + [100], 10) == (100, 3), "Failed on test with large list"

def test_solution_factorial_large_n():
    # Check the factorial of large number
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 3, 5], 9) == (4, 3), "Failed on test with large factorial number"
    
def test_solution_extra_at_start_large_target():
    # For 15!, the factorial starts with 1
    assert solution([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 15) == (1, 1), "Failed on test with extra at start and large target"
<|Test End|>

These adjustments should ensure that the syntax errors are eliminated and the tests correctly reflect the expected behavior of the function.
