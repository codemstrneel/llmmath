QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of dictionaries, each containing a "date" key with the value in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, and a target integer. For each dictionary, extract the year, month, and day from the date using regular expressions. Calculate the sum of the year, month, and day, and check if this sum is divisible by the target integer. If divisible, interchange the year and day in the date string within the dictionary. Then, group these modified dictionaries into sublists of length n, discarding any dictionaries that do not fit into complete sublists. Return the list of sublists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issues in the previous attempts seem to arise from a misunderstanding about how the year and day interchange should be formatted and the calculation of the sum to determine divisibility. Let's adjust the solution and focus particularly on the part responsible for evaluating and modifying the dates. Here's how we can improve the solution and test it appropriately:

- Correcting the pattern for changing the date format to match the task's request.
- Fixing any logical inconsistencies in the date manipulation process.
- Ensuring tests are aligned with the solution's requirements and correct logical error checks.

Let's address these issues:

import re

def solution(dicts, target, n):
    """

    and return groups of modified dictionaries in sublists of length n.
    """
    valid_dicts = []
    date_pattern = re.compile(r"(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})")

    for d in dicts:
        if 'date' in d and isinstance(d['date'], str):
            match = date_pattern.fullmatch(d['date'])
            if match:
                year, month, day = map(int, match.groups())
                date_sum = year + month + day
                
                if date_sum % target == 0:
                    # Interchange year and day
                    modified_date = f"{day:02d}-{month:02d}-{year:04d}"
                    new_dict = d.copy()
                    new_dict['date'] = modified_date
                    valid_dicts.append(new_dict)
                    
    # Group into sublists of length n, discard incomplete groups
    result = [valid_dicts[i:i+n] for i in range(0, len(valid_dicts), n) if len(valid_dicts[i:i+n]) == n]
