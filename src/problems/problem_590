QUESTION

Write a function to calculate the product of all unique even numbers from the given list of integers.

SOL & TESTS

Certainly! Below is the solution for calculating the product of all unique even numbers from a given list of integers, along with unit tests using pytest.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def product_of_unique_evens(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the product of all unique even numbers in the list.
    :param numbers: A list of integers.
    :return: The product of all unique even numbers.
    """
    unique_evens = set(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)
    product = 1
    for num in unique_evens:
        product *= num
    return product
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import product_of_unique_evens

def test_product_of_unique_evens_all_unique_evens():
    assert product_of_unique_evens([2, 4, 6, 8]) == 384  # 2 * 4 * 6 * 8

def test_product_of_unique_evens_with_duplicates():
    assert product_of_unique_evens([2, 4, 6, 8, 2, 4]) == 384  # 2 * 4 * 6 * 8, duplicates ignored

def test_product_of_unique_evens_no_evens():
    assert product_of_unique_evens([1, 3, 5, 7]) == 1  # No even numbers, product is 1

def test_product_of_unique_evens_mixed_numbers():
    assert product_of_unique_evens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6]) == 48  # 2 * 4 * 6

def test_product_of_unique_evens_empty_list():
    assert product_of_unique_evens([]) == 1  # Empty list, product defaults to 1
