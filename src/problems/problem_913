QUESTION

**Question 6:**
Write a function that first finds the longest chain of pairs that can be formed from a given list of pairs. Then, using this chain, identify and return a list of unique character sequences from a given string such that no two subsequences in this list share the same set of starting or ending characters from their corresponding positions in the original string. The function should ensure that none of these subsequences overlap each other in terms of their position in the original string and each subsequence should maintain the order of characters as they appear in the original string. 

**Example:**

Given pairs = \[(5, 6), (3, 4), (1, 2)], the longest chain is \[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)].

Given string = "abcdbc", possible unique character sequences can be \["abc", "dbc"\]. 

The function should return \["abc", "dbc"\].

SOL & TESTS

To solve this problem, we need a two-step approach. First, we will derive the longest chain of pairs from the input list of pairs. Then we will extract unique character sequences from a given string such that none of these subsequences overlap, and each sequence maintains the order of characters. Here's the solution to accomplish these tasks:

<|Solution Begin|> 
```python
def longest_chain_of_pairs(pairs):
    # Function to find the longest chain from a list of pairs
    pairs.sort()  # sort based on the first element of the pair
    n = len(pairs)
    
    # dp array to store the maximum chain length ending at each position
    dp = [1] * n
    
    # Using dynamic programming to find the longest chain
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if pairs[j][1] < pairs[i][0]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    # max chain length
    max_chain_len = max(dp)
    
    # Reconstructing the chain
    longest_chain = []
    
    end_val = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if dp[i] == max_chain_len and (not longest_chain or pairs[i][1] < end_val):
            longest_chain.append(pairs[i])
            end_val = pairs[i][0]
            max_chain_len -= 1
            
    return longest_chain[::-1]  # return the chain in correct order

def unique_sequences_from_chain(string, chain):
    # Function to find unique sequences in the string based on chain indices
    chain_start_indices = [x[0] for x in chain]
    chain_end_indices = [x[1] for x in chain]
    
    unique_sequences = []
    current_index = 0
    
    for start, end in zip(chain_start_indices, chain_end_indices):
        # Add string from start to end index (inclusive)
        unique_sequences.append(string[start-1:end])
    
    return unique_sequences
    
def find_unique_sequences(pairs, string):
    longest_chain = longest_chain_of_pairs(pairs)
    return unique_sequences_from_chain(string, longest_chain)
```

    string = "abcdefghij"

    assert result == ["abcdefghij"]
```
<|Test End|>

In this implementation:
- We first find the longest chain of pairs using dynamic programming. 
- We then extract character sequences from the string based on the longest sequence of pairs found.
- The tests ensure this works under various scenarios, including no chain, single-pair chain, and overlapping pairs.
