QUESTION

New Question: Write a function to sum elements in two equally-sized lists and then return the maximum possible sum by rearranging elements from both lists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the issue with the test case `test_solution_maximum_sum` which failed, let's revisit the logic and expectation of this test case with the correct understanding:

### Review:
Given two equally-sized lists, the goal is to achieve the highest sum by selecting the largest elements from a merged list of both lists. Hence, after sorting the combined list of values, we should sum the top `n` elements (where `n` is the length of each input list).

### Failed Test Analysis:
- **Test `test_solution_maximum_sum`:**
  - Expected that sum of the largest elements from both lists combined should be `24`, but this was incorrect based on manual verification. The expected outcome derived must be calculated based on sorted results.

Here's the correction approach:

1. Combine the two lists.
2. Sort the combined list in descending order.
3. Take the sum of the top `n` elements from this sorted list.
4. Ensure test expectations match this logic.

Let's adjust the test expectation for `test_solution_maximum_sum`:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(list1, list2):
    """
    Returns the maximum possible sum by rearranging elements from two equally-sized lists.
    """
    if not list1 or not list2 or len(list1) != len(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists must be of the same non-zero length")
    
    merged_list = list1 + list2
    merged_list.sort(reverse=True)
    
    return sum(merged_list[:len(list1)])
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_solution_basic():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) == 15

def test_solution_with_zeros():
    assert solution([0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]) == 0

def test_solution_with_negative_numbers():
    assert solution([-1, -2, -3], [-4, -5, -6]) == -6  # corrected expectation to match the logic

def test_solution_with_mixed_sign_numbers():
    assert solution([-10, 5, 4], [-2, 3, 1]) == 12

def test_solution_error_on_unequal_list_lengths():
    try:
        solution([1, 2], [1, 2, 3])
    except ValueError as e:
        assert str(e) == "Lists must be of the same non-zero length"

def test_solution_error_on_empty_lists():
    try:
        solution([], [])
    except ValueError as e:
        assert str(e) == "Lists must be of the same non-zero length"

def test_solution_maximum_sum():
    assert solution([7, 1, 3], [9, 5, 2]) == 21  # manual recalculation: [9, 7, 5] = 21

<|Test End|>
```

### Explanation:
For `test_solution_maximum_sum`, when lists `[7, 1, 3]` and `[9, 5, 2]` are combined `[7, 1, 3, 9, 5, 2]` and sorted to `[9, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1]`, the top 3 elements `[9, 7, 5]` indeed sum to `21`, not `24`. This ensures alignment with intended logic.
