QUESTION

Write a function that takes a camel case string representation of a series of fractional numbers, verifies if each fraction is a valid representation (e.g., "1/2", "3/4"), converts it to a snake case string, and then returns the fractions as a tuple of floats.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's resolve the syntax issue by ensuring the solution and test sections are formatted correctly without extra Python code block markers. We'll remove the incorrect markup, redefine the solution correctly and align the test case handling with appropriate exception management.

### Revised and Corrected Implementation

This includes:
- A refined understanding and parsing of the string.
- Validating and handling valid fraction representations.
- Ensuring syntax and test consistency for correct implementation.

Here's the fixed solution and its accompanying tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import re

def solution(camel_case_string):
    """
    Parses camel case string representing fractional numbers
    and returns those fractions as a tuple of floats.
    """
    # Mapping words to corresponding fraction components
    word_to_number = {
        "One": 1, "Two": 2, "Three": 3, "Four": 4, "Five": 5,
        "Six": 6, "Seven": 7, "Eight": 8, "Nine": 9, "Ten": 10,
        "Half": (1, 2), "Third": (1, 3), "Fourth": (1, 4), "Quarter": (1, 4),
        "Fifth": (1, 5), "Sixth": (1, 6), "Seventh": (1, 7), "Eighth": (1, 8),
        "Ninth": (1, 9), "Tenth": (1, 10)
    }
    
    # Use regex to split the camel case string into parts
    parts = re.findall('[A-Z][a-z]*', camel_case_string)
    
    fractions = []
    for i in range(0, len(parts), 2):
        if i + 1 < len(parts):
            numerator_word = parts[i]
            denominator_word = parts[i + 1]
            
            # Check if the words are in the word_to_number mapping
            if (numerator_word in word_to_number and 
                    isinstance(word_to_number[numerator_word], int) and 
                    denominator_word in word_to_number and 
                    isinstance(word_to_number[denominator_word], tuple)):
                num = word_to_number[numerator_word]
                den_num, den_den = word_to_number[denominator_word]
                fractions.append(num / (den_num / den_den))
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid fraction representation: {numerator_word} {denominator_word}")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Incomplete fraction representation")
    
    return tuple(fractions)
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
import pytest
from solution import solution

def test_valid_fractions():
    assert solution("OneHalf") == (0.5,)
    assert solution("ThreeQuarters") == (0.75,)
    assert solution("FiveSixths") == (5/6,)

def test_combined_fractions():
    assert solution("OneHalfThreeQuartersFiveSixths") == (0.5, 0.75, 5/6)

def test_invalid_fractions():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        solution("OneEleven")  # 'Eleven' is not recognized

def test_mixed_valid_invalid():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        solution("OneHalfInvalid")

def test_incomplete_fraction():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        solution("Three")  # Incomplete fraction

def test_unrecognized_word():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        solution("TenTenths")  # Requires two-part words to form a fraction

def test_case_sensitivity():
    assert solution("oneHalfThreeQuarters".title()) == (0.5, 0.75)
```
<|Test End|>

This outputs the expected form, checking fractions correctly represented in CamelCase and testing both valid and invalid inputs thoroughly. The adjustments reflect parsing nuances and ensure the solution adheres to the problem requirements.
