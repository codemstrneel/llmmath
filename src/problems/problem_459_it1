QUESTION

Write a Python function that generates a square matrix filled with consecutive integers starting from 1 in spiral order. From this matrix, identify the first four unique integers located on the corners of the innermost spiral layer. Calculate the area of the tetrahedron using these four integers as the lengths of its edges. Then, generate all unique sublists from these four integers where each sublist has a maximum length of 2, and rotate each sublist to the right by a specified number of positions, wrapping around appropriately if necessary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

There seems to be a syntax error due to using `"""` incorrectly in some commented parts. Additionally, the solution and tests should be wrapped in triple backticks (`\`\`\``). Let's fix the syntax and make sure everything is well-formatted.

Here is the corrected version of the solution and the test cases:

These changes should address the syntax error issues and ensure that the code is ready for execution with the tests.
