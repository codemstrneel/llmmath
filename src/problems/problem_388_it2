QUESTION

Write a function to extract and return the sum of all prime numbers found within the year, month, and date sections of a URL. Assume the URL will always contain a date in the format: `/year/month/date/`, and use regular expressions to identify these segments.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's review and correct the issues in the failed tests.

For the test `test_solution_with_prime_year`, the issue was with the expectation. Prime numbers are identified correctly, and thus we need to correct the expectation in the assertion. In this test, both `2011` and `9` are prime.

For the test `test_solution_with_no_prime_components`, `21` is not a prime number (factors: 1, 3, 7, 21). Therefore, it should also return 0 since none of the components are prime numbers.

Let's adjust these tests accordingly.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import re

def solution(url):
    """
    Extracts and returns the sum of all prime numbers found within the year, month, and date sections of a URL.
    Assume the URL will always contain a date in the format: `/year/month/date/`.
    """
    def is_prime(n):
        """ Helper function to check if a number is prime. """
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    # Find all numbers in the format /year/month/date/ using regular expressions
    matches = re.findall(r'/(\d{4})/(\d{1,2})/(\d{1,2})/', url)
    
    if not matches:
        return 0

    year, month, day = map(int, matches[0])
    date_numbers = [year, month, day]
    
    # Sum primes found in these numbers
    prime_sum = sum(number for number in date_numbers if is_prime(number))
    
    return prime_sum
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_with_prime_components():
    url = "/2023/07/29/"
    assert solution(url) == 36  # 7 (prime) + 29 (prime) = 36

def test_solution_with_no_prime_components():
    url = "/2024/04/21/"
    assert solution(url) == 0  # No prime numbers in 2024, 4, 21

def test_solution_with_prime_year():
    url = "/2011/04/09/"
    assert solution(url) == 2020  # 2011 (prime) + 9 (prime) = 2020

def test_solution_with_non_prime_numbers():
    url = "/2020/06/08/"
    assert solution(url) == 0  # No prime numbers in 2020, 6, 8

def test_solution_single_month_day():
    url = "/2023/1/3/"
    assert solution(url) == 3  # Only 3 is prime

def test_solution_leap_year():
    url = "/2024/2/29/"
    assert solution(url) == 31  # 2 (prime) + 29 (prime) = 31

<|Test End|>
```

With these adjustments, the tests should accurately reflect the expected prime number extraction and summations based on correct identification of primes.
