QUESTION

**New Combined Question:**

You're tasked with designing a multifaceted function to process a collection of text strings and dictionaries. The function takes two main inputs:

1. A list of strings where each string may contain various words and sentences:
   - Extract sequences of capitalized words (each starting with an uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters).
   - Remove consecutive duplicate characters within each string, ensuring spaces are single between words, and trim leading or trailing spaces.

2. A list of dictionaries, each containing a 'value' mapped to an integer and 'attributes' mapped to a list of tuples `(label, number)`. The function should:
   - Group the dictionaries based on the remainder of their 'value' when divided by a given integer `m`.
   - For each group:
     - Count how many dictionaries have at least one tuple where the number is even.
     - Determine the maximum 'value' within that group.
     - Identify the longest 'label' from the tuples that have an even number in that group.

The output should be a tuple containing two elements:
1. A list of processed strings where sequences of capitalized words are captured, and characters are optimized.
2. A dictionary with keys as the remainders (from division by `m`) and values as tuples, each comprised of:
   - The count of dictionaries with at least one tuple containing an even number,
   - The maximum 'value' in that group,
   - The length of the longest 'label' from tuples with even numbers within that group.

This exercise calls for skills in text processing, grouping logic, and string and number analysis.
