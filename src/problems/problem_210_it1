QUESTION

Write a function to compute the total surface area of a regular prism given the base edge length and height of the prism.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there were some syntax issues in the provided code blocks. Let's correct those and ensure that the unit tests cover the necessary scenarios to validate the implementation correctly.

Hereâ€™s the corrected solution and test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import math

def solution(n, s, h):
    """
    Compute the total surface area of a regular prism.

    Parameters:
    n (int): Number of sides of the base polygon.
    s (float): Length of each side of the base polygon.
    h (float): Height of the prism.

    Returns:
    float: The total surface area of the prism.
    """
    # Area of the base polygon
    base_area = (n * s ** 2) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / n))
    
    # Perimeter of the base polygon
    perimeter = n * s
    
    # Total surface area
    surface_area = 2 * base_area + perimeter * h
    
    return surface_area
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution
import math

def test_cubical_prism():
    # A cube (square base prism with side length 2 and height 2) has surface area 6 sides of area 4 each = 24
    assert math.isclose(solution(4, 2, 2), 24, rel_tol=1e-9)

def test_triangular_prism():
    # An equilateral triangle with each side of length 3 and height of 5
    # Base area = (sqrt(3)/4) * 3^2 = 3.897
    # Perimeter = 9, Surface area = 2 * 3.897 + 9 * 5 = 52.974
    assert math.isclose(solution(3, 3, 5), 52.974, rel_tol=1e-2)

def test_pentagonal_prism():
    # A regular pentagon with each side of length 4 and height of 6
    # Base area = 27.527
    # Perimeter = 20, Surface area = 2*27.527 + 20*6 = 214.055
    assert math.isclose(solution(5, 4, 6), 214.055, rel_tol=1e-2)

def test_hexagonal_prism():
    # A regular hexagon with each side of length 10 and height of 10
    # Base area = 259.807
    # Perimeter = 60, Surface area = 2*259.807 + 60*10 = 2151.939
    assert math.isclose(solution(6, 10, 10), 2151.939, rel_tol=1e-2)

def test_common_cases():
    # A square prism (cuboid) with side lengths of 1 and height of 1
    # Total surface area is 6
    assert math.isclose(solution(4, 1, 1), 6, rel_tol=1e-9)
    # A regular triangle as base with sides of 3 and height of 0 should yield the base area only
    # Base area = (3 * 3 * 3 / (4 * tan(pi / 3)))
    expected_base_area = (3 * 3 * 3) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / 3))
    assert math.isclose(solution(3, 3, 0), expected_base_area, rel_tol=1e-9)
```

With these changes, the solution to the problem and the respective tests are formatted correctly and should now be executable without syntax errors.
