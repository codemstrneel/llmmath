QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a tuple containing the square roots of those numbers as floating-point values.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the task, we need to implement a Python function that calculates the square root of each integer in a given list and returns these square roots in the form of a tuple of floats. We'll utilize the `math` module to perform the square root operation efficiently. Additionally, we'll create unit tests using `pytest` to verify the correctness and robustness of our solution. Let's put it all together:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import math
from typing import List, Tuple

def solution(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[float, ...]:
    """
    Takes a list of integers and returns a tuple containing
    the square roots of those numbers as floating-point values.
    """
    return tuple(math.sqrt(number) for number in numbers)
<|Solution End|>
```

With the solution function in place, we proceed to compose unit tests. These will ensure that the solution accommodates various input scenarios, such as a list with positive numbers, zero, and numbers that could produce square roots with a large number of decimal places.

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_square_roots_of_integers():
    assert solution([4, 9, 16]) == (2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

def test_single_element():
    assert solution([1]) == (1.0,)

def test_zero():
    assert solution([0]) == (0.0,)

def test_mixed_integer_sizes():
    assert solution([100, 0, 225]) == (10.0, 0.0, 15.0)

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([]) == ()

def test_real_precise_roots():
    results = solution([2, 3, 5])
    assert abs(results[0] - math.sqrt(2)) < 1e-9
    assert abs(results[1] - math.sqrt(3)) < 1e-9
    assert abs(results[2] - math.sqrt(5)) < 1e-9
<|Test End|>
```

Explanation:
- We utilize Python's built-in `math.sqrt()` function to compute the square roots accurately.
- The function returns a tuple of floats which represent the square roots.
- The test cases cover normal scenarios like single and multiple positive integers, the special case of zero, an empty list, and ensuring the solution returns results with required precision.
