QUESTION

Write a function to find two closest elements from two sorted arrays.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems that the syntax error was due to incorrectly placed code block markers. Let's correct those and ensure that everything compiles correctly.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(arr1, arr2):
    i, j = 0, 0
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (None, None)

    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        current_diff = abs(arr1[i] - arr2[j])
        
        if current_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = current_diff
            closest_pair = (arr1[i], arr2[j])
        
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1

    return closest_pair
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_same_length_arrays():
    assert solution([1, 4, 10], [2, 3, 15]) == (1, 2)  # Minimal difference is 1

def test_different_length_arrays():
    assert solution([1, 3, 15, 20], [2, 4, 16]) == (3, 4)  # Closest pair is 3 and 4

def test_negative_numbers():
    assert solution([-4, -3, 0, 1], [-1, 2, 3, 10]) == (0, -1)  # Closest pair is 0 and -1

def test_empty_arrays():
    assert solution([], [1, 5, 10]) == (None, None)
    assert solution([1, 5, 10], []) == (None, None)

def test_single_element_arrays():
    assert solution([1], [5]) == (1, 5)  # Only one option
    assert solution([10], [10]) == (10, 10)  # Only one option

def test_repeated_numbers():
    assert solution([1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]) == (3, 2)  # Closest pair is 3 and 2
    assert solution([5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]) == (5, 5)  # Closer pair at any point as all are same

def test_large_numbers():
    assert solution([1000000, 2000000], [1500000, 2500000]) == (2000000, 1500000)

def test_large_array():
    assert solution(list(range(1, 10001)), list(range(10001, 20001))) == (10000, 10001)  # Last of first and first of second
```
<|Test End|>

I've fixed the annotation for correct functionality without syntax errors. The functions should now work within the `pytest` framework for unit testing and handle various edge cases.
