QUESTION

Create a Python function that performs the following tasks on a given list and integer range:

1. Remove every k'th element from the list.
2. Calculate the sum of all odd numbers within a specified range [l, r].

The function should return a tuple with the modified list and the sum of the odd numbers.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def process_list_and_find_odd_sum(lst: list, k: int, l: int, r: int) -> tuple:
    pass
```

**Parameters:**
- `lst`: A list of integers from which every k'th element is to be removed.
- `k`: An integer representing the step for removal; every k'th element should be removed.
- `l`: The lower bound of the range for the sum calculation, inclusive.
- `r`: The upper bound of the range for the sum calculation, inclusive.

**Return:**
A tuple containing:
1. The modified list after removal of every k'th element.
2. The sum of all odd numbers within the range [l, r].

**Example:**
```python
process_list_and_find_odd_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 3, 1, 10)
```
Should return:
```python
([1, 2, 4, 5, 7], 25)  # List after removing every 3rd element, Sum of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
```

    Parameters:
    lst (list): A list of integers from which every k'th element is removed.
    k (int): Index step for removal (1-based index).
    l (int): Lower bound of the range for sum calculation (inclusive).
    r (int): Upper bound of the range for sum calculation (inclusive).
    
    Returns:
