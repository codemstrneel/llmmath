QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and a tuple containing two floating-point numbers as inputs. The function should perform the following operations:

1. Identify the sum of all numbers within the list that are divisible by 3. If the sum is an even number, check a given accompanying string (with the same length as the list) to see if it contains a sequence where each character is either immediately followed or preceded by a digit (i.e., '1a2' or 'b3c'). If such a pattern exists, calculate and return the area of a trapezium where the two floating-point numbers represent the trapezium's non-parallel sides, and the sum from the divisible-by-3 numbers represents the average of the parallel sides.

2. If the sum of numbers divisible by 3 is not even or if the string pattern is absent, find the index of the first prime number in the list. If no prime number is found, return a string stating "No prime found." If a prime is found, return its index as an integer.

Example Inputs/Outputs:

- Input: num_list = [6, 9, 14, 18], lengths = (5.5, 6.5), string = "4a5b"
  Output: 69.0 (sum of numbers 6, 9, and 18 is 33, even, pattern '4a5b' present, calculate area as ((33/2) * (5.5 + 6.5))/2))

- Input: num_list = [11, 14, 17], lengths = (3.0, 4.0), string = "mnop"
  Output: "No prime found" (no numbers divisible by 3, first prime is at index 0)

- Input: num_list = [4, 6, 8], lengths = (5.0, 7.0), string = "abc1d"
  Output: "No prime found" (sum of numbers 6 is 6, even, pattern absent, no prime numbers)
