QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of tuples and a dictionary as input. The list of tuples should be chunked into sublists, each containing a maximum of n tuples, such that the sum of the integers in each tuple does not exceed a threshold t. Simultaneously, convert each key in the dictionary from camel case to snake case using a regular expression and replace the associated values with a list where each element is repeated n times using the map function. Return the modified list of sublists and the transformed dictionary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's review the solution and the tests in detail. The solution is supposed to chunk a list of tuples and transform a dictionary. A compilation error suggests there may be a formatting issue in the provided code blocks. We'll focus on correctly opening and closing the code blocks for Python.

Additionally, the solution needs to ensure:
1. Chunking of the list of tuples such that for any sublist with `n` tuples, the sum of the tuple elements must not exceed the threshold `t`.
2. Converting dictionary keys from camelCase to snake_case and mapping each value in the dictionary by repeating the elements `n` times in a flattened order.

Let's ensure the syntax is correct and the solution properly handles these requirements.

These tests cover varying inputs, including edge cases like empty inputs and single chunks, verifying that our function behaves as intended across different scenarios.
