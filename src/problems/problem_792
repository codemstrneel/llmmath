QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of mixed data types (including tuples, integers, and other types) and performs the following tasks:

1. Identify the first tuple in the list and return its position (index) in the list.
2. Additionally, check if this identified tuple contains a specified element `k`. 
3. If the tuple contains the element `k`, remove all elements from the list starting from the identified tuple (including the tuple itself) and return the modified list. If not, return the original list without modifications.

```python
def process_list_with_tuple(lst, k):
    """
    Identifies the first tuple in the list, checks if it contains element k, 
    and potentially modifies the list based on the criteria.
    
    Parameters:
    lst (list): A list containing mixed data types including tuples.
    k: An element to search for within the identified tuple.
    
    Returns:
    list: The potentially modified list based on the criteria.
