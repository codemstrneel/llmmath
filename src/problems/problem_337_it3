QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and checks if replacing the first digit of each number with the first digit of its factorial results in an increasing sequence. Use recursion to calculate factorials and map function to apply the transformation to each number in the list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there were syntax issues due to improper code block handling in your previous attempts. Let's ensure that the solution and tests are properly formatted and syntactically correct. I'll streamline it to improve clarity and reliability.

Here's the complete solution and the associated tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Recursively calculates the factorial of a given number n.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

def replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(number):
    """
    Replaces the first digit of the input number with the first digit
    of the factorial of the first digit of the number.
    """
    str_number = str(number)
    first_digit = int(str_number[0])
    first_digit_factorial = factorial(first_digit)
    first_digit_of_factorial = str(first_digit_factorial)[0]
    new_number = first_digit_of_factorial + str_number[1:]
    return int(new_number)

def solution(numbers):
    """
    Transforms each number in the list by replacing its first digit with the
    first digit of the factorial of its first digit and checks if the resulting sequence is strictly increasing.
    """
    transformed_numbers = list(map(replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit, numbers))
    return all(earlier < later for earlier, later in zip(transformed_numbers, transformed_numbers[1:]))
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit():
    assert replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(23) == 63  # 2! = 2 -> first digit is 2; 23 -> 63
    assert replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(89) == 49  # 8! = 40320 -> first digit is 4; 89 -> 49
    assert replace_first_digit_with_factorial_first_digit(412) == 212  # 4! = 24 -> first digit is 2; 412 -> 212

def test_solution_increasing_sequence():
    assert solution([23, 45, 67]) == True  # Transformed: [63, 45, 67]
    assert solution([12, 45, 122]) == True  # Transformed: [12, 45, 122]

def test_solution_non_increasing_sequence():
    assert solution([321, 45, 4]) == False  # Transformed: [621, 45, 24]
    assert solution([23, 22, 21]) == False  # Transformed: [63, 22, 21]

def test_solution_edge_cases():
    assert solution([1]) == True  # Single-element sequence
    assert solution([2, 0]) == False  # Transformed: [2, 1] - Not strictly increasing
```
<|Test End|>

This revised solution and testing suite ensure that Python syntax is correct and covers possible cases to validate the function's behavior. Each function within the solution is tested for expected behavior, focusing especially on the transformation's effect on sequence ordering.
