QUESTION

Write a function that accepts a list of lists, where each sublist contains both integers and strings. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each sublist, determine if the first three integers form a valid triangle. If they do, and the sum of these three integers is even, calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum of these integers. Accumulate this difference for all valid triangles.

2. Scan each string in the sublist for numeric values. Using a given tuple containing two integers, increment each numeric value in each string by the first integer from the tuple. If any string in the sublist has a length (after incrementation) greater than the second integer of the tuple, ignore that string for further processing.

3. Return a dictionary with:
   - "triangle_diffs": the accumulated difference of valid triangle side lengths.
   - "valid_count": the total number of strings where all numeric values were adjusted and none exceeded the length restriction described.

Assume sublists with fewer than three integers should be ignored for the triangle check, and assume that only alphanumeric characters are present in the strings.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's refine the solution and tests based on the feedback:

Issues identified:
- **Triangle Check Logic**: Ensure that only if a sublist containing three or more integers is checked for a valid triangle and the conditions for a triangle need to be revisited for correctness.
- **String Processing**: Ensure correct incrementation and length-checking logic.
- **Current Test Validations**: Review and adjust test cases based on potential misconfigurations.

Let's implement a corrected version:

        return a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b
    
    def process_string(s, increment, length_limit):
        new_length = 0
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                new_length += len(str(int(char) + increment))
            else:
                new_length += 1
                
            if new_length > length_limit:
                return False
        return True
    
    triangle_diffs = 0
    valid_count = 0
    
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Check for a valid triangle in the first three integers
        int_values = [val for val in sublist if isinstance(val, int)]
        if len(int_values) >= 3:
            a, b, c = int_values[:3]
            if is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
                if (a + b + c) % 2 == 0:
                    triangle_diffs += max(a, b, c) - min(a, b, c)
        
        # Process strings in the sublist
        strings = [val for val in sublist if isinstance(val, str)]
        increment, length_limit = adjustment_tuple
        
        for s in strings:
            if process_string(s, increment, length_limit):
                valid_count += 1
    
    return {"triangle_diffs": triangle_diffs, "valid_count": valid_count}
