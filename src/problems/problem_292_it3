QUESTION

Write a function that processes a nested list of sublists, where each sublist may contain integers or other data types. For each sublist, identify an element based on a specified position (e.g., last, second-to-last). Push these identified elements into a heap, handling any non-numeric data by filtering them out, and then retrieve and return a list of these elements, sorted from smallest to largest.

SOLUTION/TESTS

After reviewing the issues in the previous attempts, let's address the test failures by refining the solution and corresponding test cases. Here's the revised approach:

### Key Issues Identified:
1. The use of `abs(position) - 1` is incorrect for determining valid index bounds with negative indexing.
2. The test `test_solution_with_non_numeric_elements` expects an empty result, which is correct for non-numeric lists.
3. The test `test_solution_out_of_bounds_position` should correctly handle situations where `position` falls outside of the valid range for any given sublist.

### Fix:
Revisit how the indices are calculated and ensure conditions align with negative indexing behavior in Python.

### Revised Code:

<|Solution Begin|>
import heapq

def solution(nested_list, position):
    """
    Processes each sublist in the nested_list, extracts elements based on the
    provided position index, filters out non-numeric elements, pushes them into
    a heap, and returns a sorted list of these numeric elements.
    
    :param nested_list: List[List[Any]] - A list of sublists where each sublist can contain any elements.
    :param position: int - The position in each sublist from which to extract the element.
                        Can be positive or negative for different positions.
    :return: List[int|float] - A sorted list of numeric elements extracted from the sublists.
    """
    min_heap = []
    
    for sublist in nested_list:
        # Calculate correct index bounds for negative indexing
        if -len(sublist) <= position < len(sublist):  # Check for valid index range
            element = sublist[position]
            if isinstance(element, (int, float)):  # Filter out non-numeric data
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, element)
    
    sorted_elements = []
    while min_heap:
        sorted_elements.append(heapq.heappop(min_heap))
    
    return sorted_elements

def test_solution_with_integer_sublists():
    nested_list = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [-1, 4, 5],

    assert solution(nested_list, -1) == [3, 5, 8.0]

    assert solution(nested_list, -1) == []

    nested_list = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5],
        [6]
    ]
    # The sublists should only be accessed where the index is valid
    assert solution(nested_list, -2) == [1, 4]
<|Test End|>

### Explanation:
- The solution is adjusted to correctly handle both positive and negative `position` indices, checking within valid bounds using Python's indexing rules.
- The test cases reflect realistic expectations when dealing with sublists of varying contents and lengths.
