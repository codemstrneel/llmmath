QUESTION

Create a Python function that calculates the sum of all even numbers within a specified range \( l \) to \( r \), inclusive. After calculating this sum, return its result as a percentage of the area of a rectangle, for which you will also write a helper function. The input to the function consists of four integers \( w, h, l, \) and \( r \), where \( w \) is the width and \( h \) is the height of the rectangle.
