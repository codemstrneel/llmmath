QUESTION

New Question: Write a function to determine the element with the highest frequency of appearance in a given list of strings and return a tuple containing that element and its occurrence count. If there is a tie, return any one of the most frequent elements.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the failure in the empty list test case, I will adjust the solution to handle the case where the input list is empty. If the list is empty, it will return `(None, 0)` as there are no elements to count. Here's the corrected implementation:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(strings):
    """
    Determine the element with the highest frequency in the list of strings.
    
    Args:
    strings (list): A list of strings
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple with the element that has the highest frequency, and its count,
           or (None, 0) if the list is empty.
    """
    from collections import Counter
    if not strings:
        return (None, 0)
    count = Counter(strings)
    most_common_element, most_common_count = count.most_common(1)[0]
    return most_common_element, most_common_count
```
<|Solution End|>

Here are the tests, adjusting for the expected return of the solution on an empty list:

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_single_element():
    assert solution(["apple"]) == ("apple", 1)

def test_solution_unique_elements():
    result = solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
    assert result in [("apple", 1), ("banana", 1), ("cherry", 1)]

def test_solution_multiple_frequencies():
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "banana", "cherry", "cherry", "cherry"]) == ("cherry", 3)

def test_solution_tie():
    result = solution(["apple", "banana", "banana", "cherry", "cherry"])
    assert result in [("banana", 2), ("cherry", 2)]

def test_solution_all_identical():
    assert solution(["apple", "apple", "apple"]) == ("apple", 3)

def test_solution_multiple_tie():
    result = solution(["apple", "apple", "banana", "banana"])
    assert result in [("apple", 2), ("banana", 2)]

def test_solution_empty_list():
    assert solution([]) == (None, 0)
```
<|Test End|>

This updated solution now correctly returns `(None, 0)` for an empty list input, and all tests should pass.
