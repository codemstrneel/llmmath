QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a dictionary of string keys and a list of integer tuples, where each tuple consists of three elements: two integers and a list of strings. The task is to:

1. For each key-value pair in the dictionary:
   - Apply the key as a regular expression pattern to determine if it matches the initial portion of any string in the list of strings from the tuples.
   - For each string that matches, remove all consecutive duplicate characters.
   
2. Group the cleaned strings by the remainder when the length of each cleaned string is divided by `k`, where `k` is a user-specified integer representing the number of unique characters from all cleaned strings combined.

3. For each group:
   - Count how many tuples have at least one string with a cleaned version that ends in an alphanumeric character.
   - Find the maximum length of such qualifying strings within each group.

4. Return a dictionary where the keys are the remainders, and the values are tuples containing:
   - The count of tuples with at least one string ending in an alphanumeric character.
   - The maximum length of such strings within each group.

Example:
Given the dictionary `{'start': [(2, 3, ['start_here', 'begin']), (4, 5, ['quickly', 'start_again']), (6, 9, ['beginning', 'start'])]}` and `k = 5`, if the strings after processing are grouped and evaluated as described, the function should output the resulting dictionary as specified.

The logic behind this question merges concepts of regular expressions, modular arithmetic for grouping, string processing to remove consecutive duplicates, and checking string endings based on character properties.
