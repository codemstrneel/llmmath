QUESTION

Create a Python function that processes a matrix of tuples, where each tuple contains a set of integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Verify if each tuple in the matrix is a representation of numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two squares.
2. After verification, create combinations of elements in the tuples to form pairs and calculate the XOR for each pair. If the corresponding element in one tuple is larger than the element in the other tuple, include the XOR result in the final list for that row. 
3. For each row, remove duplicate tuples, ensuring that the order of elements does not affect duplication (e.g., (1, 2, 3) is considered the same as (3, 2, 1)).
4. For each row, concatenate the calculated XOR values into a string (capitalized where each character represents a unique row) and return a list of these strings across all rows.

### Example:

Given the following matrix:

```python
[
    [(3, 5), (4, 7)],
    [(5, 12), (4, 13)],
    [(7, 24), (25, 10)]
]
```

1. For each tuple, check if numbers like 3, 5, 4, 7, 12, etc., can be expressed as the sum of two squares.
2. Calculate the XOR of each valid pair in a row-based manner and compile results if element order in the tuple is properly smaller for one tuple than the other.
3. Ensure each row is unique by removing duplicate tuples irrespective of their order.
4. Return strings based on these XORed results, ordered uniquely and represented capitalized.

Note: Convert numbers resulting from XOR operations to corresponding ASCII values and their string representations for the final return. The exact format and interpretation are up to the structure of your ordinal choice.

SOL & TESTS

To solve the problem, we'll break it down into the required tasks:

1. **Check if a number can be represented as the sum of two squares**: We need a helper function to verify if a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares.
2. **XOR combinations from tuples**: We'll iterate over each row and tuple, pair elements from tuples, calculate their XOR, and store results for elements satisfying given conditions.
3. **Remove duplicate tuples**: Each row will be checked for duplicate tuples permutations, storing them as sets.
4. **Generate string from XOR results**: Produce a string from XOR results, interpreting each as ASCII characters.

Here is the detailed solution with code:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def is_sum_of_two_squares(n):
    """Check if a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares."""
    if n < 0:
        return False
    for i in range(int(n**0.5) + 1):
        j = n - i*i
        if j >= 0 and int(j**0.5)**2 == j:
            return True
    return False

def process_matrix(matrix):
    """Process a matrix of tuples according to the specifications."""
    result = []
    for row in matrix:
        xor_results = []
        unique_tuples = set()
        # Verify number as sum of two squares and perform XOR calculations
        for t in row:
            if all(is_sum_of_two_squares(num) for num in t):
                for i, a in enumerate(t):
                    for b in t[i+1:]:
                        if a > b:  # Include when element a is greater
                            xor_results.append(a ^ b)
        
        # Producing unique tuples in a row
        for i in range(len(row)):
            current_tuple = tuple(sorted(row[i]))
            unique_tuples.add(current_tuple)
        
        # Convert calculated XOR results to a capitalized string
        xor_string = ''.join(chr(result + ord('A')) for result in xor_results)
        
        # Add to result list
        result.append(xor_string)
    
    # Remove duplicates (tuples) based on any permutation
    final_result = []
    seen_tuples = set()
    for xor_string in result:
        tuple_rep = tuple(sorted(map(ord, xor_string)))
        if tuple_rep not in seen_tuples:
            seen_tuples.add(tuple_rep)
            final_result.append(xor_string)

    return final_result
<|Solution End|>
```

In this solution:
- `is_sum_of_two_squares` function checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of two squares.
- `process_matrix` function processes each row of the matrix according to the provided specifications, calculating XOR for valid pairs, ensuring tuple uniqueness, and converts results into strings based on unique XORed values.

Now, let's implement unit tests to verify the solution using pytest style:

```python
<|Test Begin|>
import pytest
from solution import is_sum_of_two_squares, process_matrix

def test_is_sum_of_two_squares():
    assert is_sum_of_two_squares(5) == True  # 5 = 1^2 + 2^2
    assert is_sum_of_two_squares(4) == True  # 4 = 2^2 + 0^2
    assert is_sum_of_two_squares(10) == True # 10 = 1^2 + 3^2
    assert is_sum_of_two_squares(3) == True  # 3 = 1^2 + 1^2
    assert is_sum_of_two_squares(2) == True  # 2 = 1^2 + 1^2
    assert is_sum_of_two_squares(1) == True  # 1 = 1^2 + 0^2
    assert is_sum_of_two_squares(0) == True  # 0 = 0^2 + 0^2
    assert is_sum_of_two_squares(-1) == False
    assert is_sum_of_two_squares(8) == False # 8 cannot be expressed as sum of two squares
    
def test_process_matrix():
    matrix = [
        [(3, 5), (4, 7)],
        [(5, 12), (4, 13)],
        [(7, 24), (25, 5)]
    ]
    result = process_matrix(matrix)
    assert isinstance(result, list)
    assert 'B' in result  # XOR of 7 and 4 might yield 3 resulting C -> ASCII x'03'
    # Individual scenarios could add sufficient cases if needed

def test_process_matrix_empty():
    assert process_matrix([]) == []
<|Test End|>
```

In the unit tests, we ensure:
- The `is_sum_of_two_squares` function correctly identifies numbers sum of two squares.
- The `process_matrix` function processes and returns data as strings based on the specifications.
