QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of pairs of integers and returns the kth element of a new list formed by adding the sum of each pair's integers to separate lists based on whether the sums are odd or even. First, construct one list of odd sums and another list of even sums, then merge them to place the odd sums before the even sums, and finally return the kth element from this merged list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

There is an inconsistency in the `test_solution_basic` expected results explanation and testing. Let's address this by recalculating the expected merged lists for those test cases to ensure they are correct. Here's the revised implementation and updated test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(pairs, k):
    """
    This function processes a list of integer pairs, creates separate lists of odd and even sums,
    then merges them with odd sums first, and finally returns the kth element of the merged list.
    
    :param pairs: List of tuples, each containing two integers.
    :param k: Index (0-based) of the element to retrieve from the merged list.
    :return: The kth element from the merged list of sums.
    """
    odd_sums = []
    even_sums = []
    
    for a, b in pairs:
        sum_pair = a + b
        if sum_pair % 2 == 0:
            even_sums.append(sum_pair)
        else:
            odd_sums.append(sum_pair)
    
    # Merge lists with odd sums first
    merged_list = odd_sums + even_sums
    
    # Return the kth element
    return merged_list[k]

These tests have been recalibrated correctly to match the expectations derived from the function logic. Please review and ensure that the running of these tests aligns with your expectations.
