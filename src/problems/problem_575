QUESTION

Design a Python function that calculates the sum of all even numbers within a specified range \( l \) to \( r \), inclusive. After obtaining this sum, determine the remainder when divided by the area of a triangle. Create a helper function to calculate the triangular area. Assume the input to the function includes six integers \( b, h, l, r, x, \) and \( y \), where \( b \) is the triangle's base, \( h \) is its height, and \( (x, y) \) represents a provided point within or on the triangle. The function must also return a Boolean indicating if the point \( (x, y) \) lies within the boundaries of the triangle using other helper functions.
