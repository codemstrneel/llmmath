QUESTION

Write a Python function to find the sum of squares of binomial coefficients for a given integer n, and return the result modulo a prime number p.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's fix the implementation and unit tests. The attempt seems to have misunderstood binomial coefficient calculation in terms of arguments passed for factorial calculations. Also, it seems to have misunderstood the calculation for binomial coefficient and Fermat's theorem. Let's correct those mistakes.

### Corrected Python Function:

I'll correct the calculation of binomial coefficients using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverses and fix the test cases accordingly.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n, p):
    """
    Finds the sum of squares of binomial coefficients for the given n,
    modulo a prime number p, which is equivalent to the central binomial
    coefficient C(2n, n) modulo p.
    """
    def factorial_mod(x, p):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, x + 1):
            result = (result * i) % p
        return result
    
    # calculating C(2n, n) % p
    def binomial_coefficient_mod(n, k, p):
        if k > n:
            return 0
        numerator = factorial_mod(n, p)
        denominator = (factorial_mod(k, p) * factorial_mod(n - k, p)) % p
        return (numerator * pow(denominator, p-2, p)) % p  # Fermat's little theorem

    return binomial_coefficient_mod(2 * n, n, p)
<|Solution End|>

### Corrected Unit Tests:

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_base():
    assert solution(2, 7) == 6  # C(4, 2) = 6 % 7 = 6
    assert solution(3, 13) == 7  # C(6, 3) = 20 % 13 = 7
    assert solution(0, 5) == 1  # C(0, 0) = 1 % 5 = 1
    assert solution(1, 11) == 2  # C(2, 1) = 2 % 11 = 2

def test_solution_large_n():
    assert solution(10, 101) == 92  # C(20, 10) % 101

def test_solution_large_prime():
    assert solution(5, 10007) == 252  # C(10, 5) = 252 % 10007 = 252

def test_solution_edge_cases():
    # Large `n`, ensure range does not cause overflow issues
    assert solution(1000, 99991) is not None  # Large n value, check execution

def test_solution_modulus_property():
    # Test identity with modulus property
    prime = 10007
    assert solution(3, prime) == 20 % prime
    assert solution(4, prime) == 70 % prime
```
<|Test End|>

These changes to the implementation and the associated test cases ensure that the solution accurately computes the sum of the squares of binomial coefficients modulo a prime.
