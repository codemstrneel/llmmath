QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes as input a list of strings and performs the following tasks:

1. Identify the top two most repeated strings in the list. If there is a tie in frequency for the second position, consider any of the tied strings.
2. For each of these top two strings, assume they represent point coordinates and parse each string into two separate numbers, treating them as 'x' and 'height'. For instance, if a string is "3,4", 'x' is 3 and 'height' is 4.
3. Using the 'x' and 'height' values, consider each point as the base left corner of a right-angled triangle, where 'height' is the height. Compute the area of these triangles.
4. Return a list containing:
   - A dictionary for each of the top two strings, where the key is the string and the value is the computed area of its associated triangle.

Ensure the function handles cases such as an empty list input and lists with all identical strings.

Example:

```python
def analyze_string_triangles(strings):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage
result = analyze_string_triangles(["3,4", "5,12", "3,4", "5,12", "5,12"])
print(result)
# Output: [{"5,12": 30.0}, {"3,4": 6.0}]
```

SOL & TESTS

```python
from collections import Counter

def analyze_string_triangles(strings):
    # Step 1: Counter to identify most repeated strings
    string_counts = Counter(strings)
    most_common_strings = string_counts.most_common(2)
    
    # Step 2: Parse strings as coordinates
    def parse_coordinates(s):
        x, height = map(int, s.split(','))
        return x, height
    
    # Step 3: Calculate triangle area
    def calculate_area(x, height):
        return 0.5 * x * height
    
    # Step 4: Build the result list
    result = []
    
    for s, _ in most_common_strings:
        x, height = parse_coordinates(s)
        area = calculate_area(x, height)
        result.append({s: area})
    
    return result
```
