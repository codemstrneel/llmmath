QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list wrapped in a singleton tuple and a range (two integers defining the lower and upper bounds, inclusive). The function should return a tuple containing two elements: a copy of the list from the singleton tuple with all numbers converted to integers, and the count of how many elements in this copied list fall within the given range.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's revise the test `test_solution_basic` to match a correct expected result and ensure proper coverage of the function's requirements and its output predictions.

The problem was with the expectation concerning the range checking. Let's recalculate correctly:

For the input `([1.5, 2.6, 3.7],), 2, 3`, the list should be `[1, 2, 3]` when converted to integers, and the numbers within the range `[2, 3]` based on this converted list are `2` and `3`. So, the correct count should be `2`.

Let's go ahead and update the unit test.

def solution(singleton_tuple, lower_bound, upper_bound):
    """

    Returns a tuple with a list of integers and the count of elements within the range.
    """
    # Unpack the list from the singleton tuple
    lst = singleton_tuple[0]
    
    # Convert all elements to integers
    int_list = [int(x) for x in lst]
    
    # Count elements within the inclusive range
    count_within_range = sum(lower_bound <= x <= upper_bound for x in int_list)
    
    return int_list, count_within_range
