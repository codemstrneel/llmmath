QUESTION

Write a function that combines the following tasks using a list of strings and a list of lists containing integers:

1. For each string, remove all characters that are not letters or numbers using regex. Then, if the cleaned string contains any numeric values, increment each numeric value by 1. Track the count of such modified strings where the length of the string becomes an even number after modification.

2. From the list of lists, identify and return the sublist whose sum of elements is the highest. Additionally, check if this sublist, viewed as side lengths, forms a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of any two side lengths is greater than the third.

Finally, return a tuple containing two elements: the count of strings from step 1 and a Boolean indicating whether the sublist from step 2 forms a valid triangle.

        cleaned = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', s)
        # Increment each numeric value by 1
        modified = ''.join(str(int(c) + 1) if c.isdigit() else c for c in cleaned)
        return modified
    
    def is_valid_triangle(sides):
        # A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third
        a, b, c = sorted(sides)
        return a + b > c

    # Step 1: Process each string
    even_length_count = 0
    for string in strings:
        modified_string = clean_and_modify_string(string)
        if len(modified_string) % 2 == 0:
            even_length_count += 1

    # Step 2: Find the sublist with the maximum sum
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_sum_sublist = []

    for numbers in lists_of_numbers:
        current_sum = sum(numbers)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_sum_sublist = numbers

    # Check if max_sum_sublist forms a valid triangle
    if len(max_sum_sublist) == 3:
        valid_triangle = is_valid_triangle(max_sum_sublist)
    else:
        valid_triangle = False

    return (even_length_count, valid_triangle)
