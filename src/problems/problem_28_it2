QUESTION

Write a python function to determine if a given integer can be represented as the sum of multiples of two square numbers, with each multiple being a polite number.

SOLUTION/TESTS

After reviewing the problem and the previous tests, it appears that the logic to decompose a number into sums of multiples of perfect squares with polite number coefficients may need reassessment. Let's refine the solution and create comprehensive test cases.

Polite numbers are all positive integers that are not in the form of \(2^n\). Therefore, for a number to be represented as the sum of multiples of two squares using polite numbers, the logic of finding polite multipliers must be correctly implemented.

Letâ€™s refactor the solution and tests accordingly:

<|Solution Begin|>
def is_polite_number(n):
    """
    Returns True if n is a polite number (not a power of 2).
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return n & (n - 1) != 0

def solution(x):
    """
    Determines if the given integer x can be represented as the sum of the multiples of two square numbers
    where each multiple is a polite number.
    """
    if x <= 0:
        return False
    
    max_square_root = int(x**0.5)
    
    for i in range(1, max_square_root + 1):
        p = i**2
        for j in range(1, max_square_root + 1):
            q = j**2
            for a in range(1, x // p + 1):
                if not is_polite_number(a):
                    continue
                remaining = x - a * p
                if remaining < 0:
                    break
                b = remaining // q
                if remaining % q == 0 and b > 0 and is_polite_number(b):
                    return True
    return False
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_polite_case():
    # 10 can be expressed as 1*3^2 (9) + 1*1^2 (1)
    assert solution(10) == True

def test_solution_non_polite_case():
    # 17 cannot be expressed as the sum of multiples of squares where multiples are polite.
    assert solution(17) == False

def test_solution_negative_or_zero_input():
    # Negative numbers and zero cannot be expressed as a valid sum.
    assert solution(0) == False
    assert solution(-5) == False

def test_solution_small_polite_case():
    # 13 can be expressed as 1*3^2 + 1*2^2 (9 + 4)
    assert solution(13) == True

def test_solution_large_polite_case():
    # 34 can be expressed as 1*5^2 + 1*3^2 (25 + 9)
    assert solution(34) == True

def test_solution_edge_case_square_number():
    # 16 can be expressed as 2*2^2 with polite numbers.
    assert solution(16) == True

def test_solution_complicated_case():
    # 29 can be expressed as 1*5^2 + 2*2^2 (25 + 4)
    assert solution(29) == True
<|Test End|>

This solution should accurately represent the functionality needed, considering numbers correctly as polite or not, and decomposing using possible square numbers. The tests now reflect a more comprehensive set of scenarios to validate this behavior.
