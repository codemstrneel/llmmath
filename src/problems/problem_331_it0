QUESTION

Create a function that takes a dictionary and an integer m as input. The keys in the dictionary are strings, and the values are sets of numbers. The function should return a new dictionary where each original set of numbers is transformed by calculating the product of all numbers and then creating a list containing this product repeated m times using a list comprehension.
