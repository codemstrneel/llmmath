QUESTION

Here's a novel coding question that combines elements from your given questions:

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes a list of strings. Each string can potentially contain multiple space-separated substrings, where each substring is either a series of integers or floats. The function should do the following:

1. Convert each substring into a tuple. If the substring represents integers, convert it accordingly; if the substring represents floats, convert it into a frozen set.
   
2. Identify patterns across the tuples and frozen sets by determining the type of sequence they form. For tuples of integers, find if the numbers can form consecutive sequences. For frozen sets of floats, determine if all numbers in the set are within a range of 0.5 of each other (indicating closeness or some form of 'equilateral' behavior with floats).

3. The function should return a dictionary with two keys: "integer_sequences" and "float_closeness". The value for "integer_sequences" should be a tuple with two elements: (a) the longest length of consecutive integers found across all tuples and (b) a list of all tuples that form consecutive sequences. The value for "float_closeness" should be a list of all the frozensets where all elements are within a range of 0.5 of each other.

The function should ensure that empty or invalid substrings are ignored and should handle any exceptions that arise from incorrect conversions gracefully. If no valid tuples or frozen sets are found, return an empty dictionary.
