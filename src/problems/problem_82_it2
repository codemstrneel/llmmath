QUESTION

Write a function that rotates a given list of strings by a specified number of positions to the left. Then, for each string in the rotated list, use regex to find and return the starting index of all occurrences of a specific substring within each string.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The issues seem to stem from incorrect expectations in the test cases, specifically regarding the rotation and handling regular expression searches for substrings. Let's fix both the solution and the tests to correctly reflect how string searching and list rotation should be handled.

### Corrections needed:
1. **Rotation Expectation**: Ensuring that the list rotates correctly by handling lists of any size.
2. **Regular Expression Searches**: Understand and test the occurrence index specificity correctly, especially when the substring is empty.

Let's correct these and improve the solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import re
from typing import List

def solution(strings: List[str], rotate_by: int, substring: str) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Rotates a given list of strings by 'rotate_by' positions to the left.
    For each string in the rotated list, finds the starting index of all 
    occurrences of 'substring' using regex.
    """
    n = len(strings)
    if n == 0:  # Handle empty list case
        return []

    # Step 1: Rotate the list of strings to the left by 'rotate_by'
    rotated_strings = strings[rotate_by % n:] + strings[:rotate_by % n]

    # Step 2: Find all occurrences of 'substring' in each rotated string
    result = []
    for string in rotated_strings:
        matches = [match.start() for match in re.finditer(re.escape(substring), string)]
        result.append(matches)

    return result
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_rotate_and_find_substring_occurrences():
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 1, "a") == [[1, 3], [1, 3]]
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 2, "e") == [[1], [4]]
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 0, "n") == [[], [2], []]
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 3, "a") == [[0], [1, 3]]

    # Test with empty substring
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 1, "") == [
        list(range(len("banana") + 1)), 
        list(range(len("cherry") + 1)), 
        list(range(len("apple") + 1))
    ]

def test_edge_cases():
    assert solution([], 2, "a") == []
    
    assert solution(["abcd"], 1, "") == [list(range(4 + 1))]  # All positions in "bcd"
    
    assert solution(["a", "b", "c"], 5, "a") == [[0], [], []]
    
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 1, "z") == [[], []]

def test_no_occurrences():
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 1, "z") == [[], []]
    
def test_multiple_occurrences():
    assert solution(["banana", "apple", "banana"], 2, "an") == [[1, 3], [1, 3]]
    
def test_rotation_with_repeated_patterns():
    assert solution(["abc", "def", "abc"], 2, "abc") == [[0], [0]]
```
<|Test End|>

### Explanation of Changes:
- Test cases were corrected to check the correct rotation position and the correct search for the substring, including handling when the substring is empty.
- The `solution` function logic was reviewed and kept consistent with expectations.
- All boundary and typical cases including non-existent substring, empty string, and how substring indexing is handled are covered.
