QUESTION

Write a function that takes two lists: a list of numbers and a list of strings. The function should return a new list where each element is a tuple. Each tuple should contain an index, the sum of polite numbers up to that index from the list of numbers, and a concatenation of the corresponding string from the list of strings with whether the number at that index has even or odd parity. If the lists differ in length, only process up to the length of the shorter list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

I see the errors in the previous attempts were due to incorrect formatting with markdown code block delimiters in the given solution and test code. Let's correct this by providing the code without such delimiters and ensuring everything is in working Python syntax:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(numbers, strings):
    result = []
    cumulative_sum = 0
    for i in range(min(len(numbers), len(strings))):
        if numbers[i] % 2 == 0:
            cumulative_sum += numbers[i]
        parity = "even" if numbers[i] % 2 == 0 else "odd"
        combined_string = strings[i] + parity
        result.append((i, cumulative_sum, combined_string))
    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_with_equal_lengths():
    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    strings = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    assert solution(numbers, strings) == [
        (0, 2, "aeven"),
        (1, 2, "bodd"),
        (2, 6, "ceven"),
        (3, 6, "dodd")
    ]

def test_solution_with_different_lengths():
    numbers = [1, 4, 2]
    strings = ["x", "y"]
    assert solution(numbers, strings) == [
        (0, 0, "xodd"),
        (1, 4, "yeven"),
    ]

def test_solution_with_empty_lists():
    assert solution([], []) == []
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], []) == []
    assert solution([], ["x", "y", "z"]) == []

def test_solution_with_all_even_numbers():
    numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
    strings = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    assert solution(numbers, strings) == [
        (0, 2, "aeven"),
        (1, 6, "beven"),
        (2, 12, "ceven"),
        (3, 20, "deven")
    ]

def test_solution_with_all_odd_numbers():
    numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    strings = ["p", "q", "r", "s"]
    assert solution(numbers, strings) == [
        (0, 0, "podd"),
        (1, 0, "qodd"),
        (2, 0, "rodd"),
        (3, 0, "sodd")
    ]
```
<|Test End|>

With this corrected format, the code will be processed correctly in the testing environment. Make sure to place the solution and the tests in appropriate Python files when running the tests. The test will call the `solution` function from the `solution` module.
