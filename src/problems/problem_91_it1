QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of integers and a number representing the number of left rotations to perform on this list. After performing the rotations, compute the maximum number among the sum of squares of the integers in the rotated list and return its position in the list. If there is more than one such number, return the position of the rightmost occurrence.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the issues in the previous implementation, we need to correctly identify the position of the maximum value after computing the sum of squares of the integers in the rotated list. The problem in the previous solution was a misunderstanding of the requirement to find the position of the maximum element value after rotation and not the sum of squares among elements.

Let's correctly implement the solution and the tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(arr, rotations):
    """
    Rotates the list 'arr' to the left by 'rotations' places and returns 
    the position of the rightmost element that results in having the maximum value itself.
    """
    if not arr:
        return -1  # return -1 if the list is empty

    n = len(arr)
    rotations = rotations % n
    
    # Perform the left rotations
    rotated = arr[rotations:] + arr[:rotations]

    # Find the position of the rightmost maximum element
    max_value = max(rotated)
    max_position = len(rotated) - 1 - rotated[::-1].index(max_value)

    return max_position
