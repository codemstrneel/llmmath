QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers. This function should perform the following steps:

1. For each inner list, compute the square of each integer using a lambda function, similar to the one described in questions 1 and 5.

2. Convert these squared values into a set.

3. For each element in the set, adjust the value depending on whether its original position in the set (index) was even or odd:
   - If the index is even, raise the integer to the power of its index (like question 2, but considering only the even indices).
   - If the index is odd, multiply the integer by 3.

4. Merge all results into a single set of unique integers.

5. Finally, return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the transformed set derived from each inner list.

The function should be capable of handling both positive and negative integers across varying inner list lengths, ensuring efficient computation and transformation using lambda functions throughout.
