QUESTION

Combine concepts from Question 1 (tuples and even integers) and Question 4 (re-ordering based on a specified key order) to create a new, novel problem:

---

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a unique set of integer keys and values, and a list of even numbers. The function should return a new list of dictionaries where:

1. Each dictionary is reordered based on the order of keys specified by the list of even numbers. If a key from the list of even numbers is not present in a dictionary, it should be skipped during reordering.

2. After reordering, check if any of the reordered dictionaries contain a number of even values exceeding the maximum number of even values found in that dictionary's initial order. If this condition is satisfied for at least one dictionary, return the reordered list of dictionaries; otherwise, return an empty list.

This problem combines the concepts of handling tuples involving even integers and dictionaries' key-specific reordering based on external input, adding a layer of logical evaluation regarding the even integers.

SOL & TESTS

Sure! Here's the solution to the novel problem you've described:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def reorder_and_evaluate_dicts(dicts_list, even_keys):
    """
    Reorders the dictionaries in 'dicts_list' based on 'even_keys' and evaluates 
    the number of even values compared to the original order.
    
    Parameters:
    - dicts_list: List[Dict[int, int]] - List of dictionaries with integer keys and values.
    - even_keys: List[int] - List of even integers used to reorder dictionary keys.
    
    Returns:
    - List[Dict[int, int]]: A new list of reordered dictionaries or an empty list.

    reordered_dicts = []
    max_initial_even_count = []

    for dct in dicts_list:
        # Initial count of even values in the dictionary
        initial_even_count = sum(1 for value in dct.values() if value % 2 == 0)
        max_initial_even_count.append(initial_even_count)

        reordered_dict = {key: dct[key] for key in even_keys if key in dct}

    # Check if any reordered dictionary has more even values 
    # than its initial configuration

        if even_count > max_initial_even_count[i]:
            # At least one dictionary satisfies the condition, return the reordered list
            return [rd for _, rd in reordered_dicts]
    
    return []  # No dictionary satisfied the condition
