QUESTION

**New Question:**

Combining the core concepts from questions 1, 4, and 5, we can focus on converting string representations of tuples to integer tuples, sorting, filtering based on a product and target condition, upper casing strings, and searching within arrays.

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python function `transform_and_locate` that takes the following inputs:

1. A list of strings, each representing a tuple of integers.
2. A target integer.
3. A sorted list of unique integers.

The function must perform the following steps:

1. Convert each string in the list to its corresponding integer tuple.
2. Sort these tuples in increasing order based on the last element of each tuple.
3. Calculate the product of all but the last element in each tuple, appending this product to the tuple.
4. Remove any tuple containing a product that equals the target integer.
5. For each remaining tuple, convert the entire tuple to a string and transform it to uppercase.
6. Search for the product in the sorted list of unique integers. Include the index of the found element or -1 if not found as part of the tuple.
7. Return a list of the transformed uppercase string tuples accompanied by the search result index.

For example:
```python
def transform_and_locate(tuple_strings, target, sorted_list):
    # Your implementation here

# Example Input:
tuple_strings = ["(1, 3, 2)", "(2, 5, 3)", "(4, 6, 5)"]
target = 6
sorted_list = [2, 3, 4, 10, 15, 30, 60]

# Expected Output:
print(transform_and_locate(tuple_strings, target, sorted_list))
```

In this problem, you'll combine the following concepts:

- Conversion from string representation to integer tuples.
- Sorting tuples by the last element.
- Calculating and appending the product of tuple elements.
- Filtering based on a product condition.
- String transformation (uppercasing).
- Searching within a sorted list and handling results efficiently.

        # Find the index in the sorted_list using binary search
        index = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_list, product)
        if index != len(sorted_list) and sorted_list[index] == product:

        else:
            search_index = -1
        
        # Append the result
