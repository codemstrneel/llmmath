QUESTION

Write a Python function that, given a non-negative integer, left rotates its digits and determines if the resulting integer is a perfect square.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the issues in the unit tests for the Python function, we need to re-evaluate the logic of our test cases. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding of the expected results from the rotation and evaluation for a perfect square. Let's revise our tests for correctness.

### Key Points:
- The function rotates the digits of a number once to the left.
- Checks if the rotated number is a perfect square.

### Strategy:
- Ensure the rotated numbers are correctly evaluated.
- Ensure correct assertions for whether a number is a perfect square or not.

Let's adjust the test cases considering the correct post-rotation behavior and expected outcomes.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import math

def solution(n):
    """
    Rotates the digits of a non-negative integer n to the left and checks if the resulting integer is a perfect square.
    
    :param n: A non-negative integer to be rotated and checked.
    :return: A boolean: True if the rotated number is a perfect square, otherwise False.
    """
    if n < 10:
        return is_perfect_square(n)
    
    # Convert the number to a string to easily rotate the digits.
    str_n = str(n)
    # Rotate the digits to the left.
    rotated = int(str_n[1:] + str_n[0])
    # Check if the rotated number is a perfect square.
    return is_perfect_square(rotated)

def is_perfect_square(x):
    """
    Checks if a number is a perfect square.
    
    :param x: An integer to be checked.
    :return: A boolean: True if x is a perfect square, otherwise False.
    """
    root = math.isqrt(x)
    return root * root == x
<|Solution End|>
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_single_digit():
    assert solution(1) == True  # 1 is a perfect square
    assert solution(7) == False # 7 is not a perfect square

def test_rotation_and_perfect_square_check():
    assert solution(16) == False # Rotates to 61, not a perfect square
    assert solution(23) == False # Rotates to 32, not a perfect square
    assert solution(225) == False # Rotates to 252, not a perfect square
    assert solution(81) == False # Rotates to 18, not a perfect square
    assert solution(49) == False # Rotates to 94, not a perfect square
    assert solution(121) == False # Rotates to 211, not a perfect square

def test_large_numbers():
    assert solution(144) == True  # Rotates to 441, which is 21^2, perfect square
    assert solution(1002003004) == False # Rotation: 0020030041, not a perfect square

def test_edge_cases():
    assert solution(0) == True    # 0 is a perfect square
    assert solution(10001) == False # Rotated to 00011 (11), not a perfect square
<|Test End|>
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- Ensured each test properly reflects the expected behavior for both rotation and checking for a perfect square.
- Added and adjusted test cases to verify a variety of scenarios, focusing on both rotate operation and perfect square verification.
- Rectified assumptions about the results after rotation, ensuring logical consistency with intended logic.
