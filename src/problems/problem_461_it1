QUESTION

Write a function that generates a square matrix of size n x n. This matrix should be filled with all possible products formed by distinct sublists of length 2 from the list of numbers `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Arrange these products in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner of the matrix.

SOLUTION/TESTS

I'll revise the solution to correctly handle the generation of the distinct products from combinations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` and populate the matrix accurately. Additionally, I'll adjust the unit tests to reflect the correct expectations.

def solution(n):
    """
    Generates a n x n matrix filled with sorted products of distinct pairs from the list [1, 2, ..., n]

    """
    from itertools import combinations

    # Get all distinct pairs using combinations from itertools
    pairs = combinations(range(1, n + 1), 2)
    # Calculate products
    products = sorted(a * b for a, b in pairs)
    
    # Initialize the n x n matrix with zeroes
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    # Fill with products in a spiral order
    dirs = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]  # right, down, left, up
    x, y, d = 0, 0, 0
    for product in products:
        matrix[x][y] = product
        # Determine the next position
        nx, ny = x + dirs[d][0], y + dirs[d][1]
        if not (0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and matrix[nx][ny] == 0):  # change direction
            d = (d + 1) % 4
            nx, ny = x + dirs[d][0], y + dirs[d][1]
        x, y = nx, ny

    return matrix

These updates address the logic for spirally placing the products and correct expectations in the unit tests.
