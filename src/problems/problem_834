QUESTION

Create a Python function that evaluates a simplified transportation timetable and provides basic scheduling insights. The task involves handling numeric rounding and basic regex-based string operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the challenge:

1. **Input Format:**
   - A single string containing mixed content with both words and numbers. Words represent activities related to transportation (e.g., "arrival", "departure"), and they are interspersed with numeric substrings indicating times.
   - A fixed number that determines the precision to which numeric results should be rounded.

2. **Functionality:**
   - **Parse the String:**
     - Use regular expressions to extract times from the string. Focus on identifying patterns related to "arrival" and "departure" without complex handling.
   - **Basic Schedule Analysis:**
     - Count the number of arrivals and departures separately to provide a basic insight into the schedule.
   - **Precision Adjustment:**
     - Round any numeric time values to the specified precision.

3. **Output:**
   - A dictionary containing:
     - The number of arrivals and departures detected.
     - A list of numeric values (extracted times) rounded to the specified precision. 

This problem allows you to practice using regular expressions and rounding techniques within a simplified scheduling context.

    Analyzes a transportation timetable string.

    Args:
    schedule_string (str): The mixed content string of activities and times.
    precision (int): The decimal precision to which times should be rounded.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the number of arrivals, the number of departures,
          and a list of rounded times.

    # Find all times in the schedule string
    times = [float(time) for time in re.findall(time_pattern, schedule_string)]
    
    # Round times to specified precision
    rounded_times = [round(time, precision) for time in times]
    
    # Count occurrences of 'arrival' and 'departure'
