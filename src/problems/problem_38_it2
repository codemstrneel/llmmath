QUESTION

Write a function that takes as input a list of integers, a set of excluded values, and two integers \( k \) and \( n \). The function should first identify pairs of numbers in the list that can be both expressed as the sum of two squares and are not in the excluded set. The function should then calculate the difference of each valid pair using a map and lambda function. Further, if a pair's difference is zero, the function should compute the cube of size \( k \) for that index and consider it as part of a larger cube of size \( n \). The function should return a dictionary where the keys are indices of pairs, and the values are tuples of the pair's difference and a Boolean indicating if the cube is within the larger cube's bounds.

SOLUTION/TESTS

There seems to be an error in the second attempt due to accidentally including fencing from previous examples. Let's ensure everything is correctly formatted, with no stray code fences causing syntax issues. Here's a refined version of the solution and the tests:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(lst, excluded, k, n):
    from math import sqrt
    
    def is_sum_of_two_squares(x):
        # Check if a number can be expressed as a sum of two squares
        for a in range(int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            b_squared = x - a * a
            if b_squared >= 0 and int(sqrt(b_squared)) ** 2 == b_squared:
                return True
        return False
    
    valid_pairs = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) 
                   for j in range(i + 1, len(lst))
                   if lst[i] not in excluded 
                      and lst[j] not in excluded
                      and is_sum_of_two_squares(lst[i]) 
                      and is_sum_of_two_squares(lst[j])]

    pair_differences = list(map(lambda pair: lst[pair[0]] - lst[pair[1]], valid_pairs))

    result = {}
    for idx, diff in enumerate(pair_differences):
        is_within_cube = False
        if diff == 0:
            is_within_cube = k ** 3 <= n ** 3
        result[valid_pairs[idx]] = (diff, is_within_cube)
    
    return result
<|Solution End|>
```

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_empty_list():
    assert solution([], set(), 2, 3) == {}

def test_single_element_list():
    assert solution([1], set(), 2, 3) == {}

def test_no_pairs_sum_of_squares():
    assert solution([3, 8, 10], set(), 2, 3) == {}

def test_with_exclusions():
    assert solution([5, 3, 9], {5}, 2, 3) == {}

def test_valid_pairs():
    result = solution([5, 13, 25, 10], set(), 2, 3)
    assert result == {(0, 2): (-20, False), (1, 3): (3, False)}

def test_valid_and_invalid_pairs():
    result = solution([5, 25, 13, 10], {13}, 2, 3)
    assert result == {(0, 1): (-20, False)}

def test_specific_zero_difference():
    result = solution([5, 25, 25, 10], set(), 1, 1)
    assert result == {(1, 2): (0, True)}

def test_large_k_small_n():
    result = solution([5, 25, 25, 10], set(), 4, 1)
    assert result == {(1, 2): (0, False)}
<|Test End|>
```

With these adjustments, the solution should be free from syntax errors, and the tests should comprehensively validate the logic. The updated tests take into account different scenarios ensuring the function behaves as expected.
