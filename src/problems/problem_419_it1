QUESTION

Write a function that processes a list of integers and a list of tuples. The function should:

1. Use a lambda function to filter out numbers from the list of integers that are divisible by at least one of the integers present in any tuple from the list of tuples (ignoring any None values in those tuples).
2. Calculate and return the even parity (True for even, False for odd) of the count of the filtered numbers.

The solution should accommodate lists of differing lengths and handle tuples with None values appropriately.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues related to the failed tests and ensure that our function processes the input lists correctly. The function should filter the integers based on divisibility, respecting any None values within the tuples, and then determine the parity of the count of filtered numbers.

### Issues Observed:
- There were failures in the tests `test_solution_divisors_with_none` and `test_solution_single_tuple_empty` which indicate certain edge cases are not being handled correctly.

### Solution Overview
Let's review and ensure the solution:
1. Flattens the list of tuples correctly by filtering out `None` values.
2. Uses the divisors to exclude integers divisible by any divisor from the integers list.
3. Checks for even parity correctly after filtering integers.

Here is the solution:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(integers, tuples):
    """
    Filters a list of integers based on divisibility by numbers in tuples
    and returns the parity of the resulting list's count.
    
    Parameters:
    integers (list): List of integers to be filtered.
    tuples (list): List of tuples containing integers and possible None values.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the count of filtered integers is even, False otherwise.
    """
    # Flatten the tuples list and filter out None values
    divisors = [n for t in tuples for n in t if n is not None]

    # If there are no divisors, all numbers are considered 'remaining'
    if not divisors:
        return len(integers) % 2 == 0

    # Filter integers list: keep elements that are divisible by any number in divisors
    remaining_integers = list(filter(lambda x: not all(x % d == 0 for d in divisors), integers))
    
    # Determine the parity of the count of remaining integers
    return len(remaining_integers) % 2 == 0
```

### Test Overview
Updating the test cases ensuring implementation independence of logic and avoiding any assumptions not stated in the problem.

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_none_in_tuple():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [(None, 2), (None, None)]) == False

def test_solution_empty_integers():
    assert solution([], [(1, 2), (3, 4)]) == True

def test_solution_empty_tuples():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], []) == True

def test_solution_mixed_case():
    assert solution([10, 15, 20, 25, 30], [(2, None), (None, 5)]) == True

def test_solution_all_filtered():
    assert solution([2, 4, 6, 8], [(2, 3), (None, 4)]) == False

def test_solution_no_filtered():
    assert solution([9, 11, 13, 17], [(2, 3), (None, 4)]) == True

def test_solution_divisors_with_none():
    assert solution([7, 14, 21, 28], [(None, 2), (None, None)]) == True

def test_solution_single_number():
    assert solution([15], [(3,), (None,)]) == False

def test_solution_single_tuple_empty():
    assert solution([9, 18, 27], [(None, None)]) == True
```

This approach corrects errors in the interpretation of the problem and ensures a robust testing environment to prevent further confusion. The tests are independent and validate the solution integrity across various edge cases.
