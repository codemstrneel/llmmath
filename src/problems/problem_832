QUESTION

Based on the core concepts from the given questions, here is a novel coding problem that combines elements from Question 1 (mathematical operations and triangle check) and a string processing element inspired by Questions 2 and 3:

**New Question:**
Create a Python function that performs the following tasks:

1. Given a string `s` containing a sequence of alphabetic characters and an integer `k`, split the string at uppercase letters and compute the length of each resulting segment.
2. For each segment length, cube the number if it is even.
3. Calculate the total of these cubes.
4. Determine if this total (from the cubes) can be a valid perimeter for a triangle that satisfies the constraint where the largest side is no more than `k` units longer than the smallest side.

The function should return a dictionary with the following keys:
- `'total_cubes'`: The total of the cubes of all even segment lengths.
- `'is_valid_triangle'`: A boolean indicating whether this total can form the perimeter of a valid triangle under the given constraint.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def segment_cubes_and_triangle_check(s: str, k: int) -> dict:
    pass
```

**Constraints:**
- The function should split the string using uppercase letters as delimiters.
- Consider only the lengths of segments formed between uppercase letters.
- A triangle with perimeter `P` is valid if you can choose side lengths `a`, `b`, `c` such that `a + b + c = P`, `a <= b <= c`, and `c - a <= k`.
  
This problem combines string manipulation (splitting by uppercase letters) with mathematical operations (cubing even numbers and checking triangle validity), offering an integrated challenge.
