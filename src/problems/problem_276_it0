QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes in a sorted list and checks if it's possible to modify at most two elements such that the list can be transformed into a sequence where each number is a perfect square, all the perfect squares being the same, up to a specified precision value. The function should return `True` if this adjustment is possible, otherwise `False`.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Determine whether the sorted list can be transformed into a sequence of the same perfect square with the modification of at most two elements.
2. We know that a perfect square number is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 4, 9, 16, and so on.
3. Iterate through the list and calculate the perfect square root of each element, round it, and verify if after rounding, its square matches the desired perfect square.
4. Allow the modification of at most two elements to make this transformation possible.
5. Return `True` if the transformation can be achieved, else return `False`.

    if num < 0:
        return False
    root = int(num ** 0.5)
    return root * root == num

    def can_be_modified(lst, target_square):
        modifications = 0
        for num in lst:
            if num != target_square:
                if not is_perfect_square(num):
                    return False
                square_root = round(num ** 0.5)
                if square_root * square_root != target_square:
                    modifications += 1
                    if modifications > 2:
                        return False
        return True
    
    # Check for each number's square in the list if we can make all numbers that

            perfect_square = num

Explanation of the solution:
- We first need to identify if a number is a perfect square using `is_perfect_square` function. This function checks if the integer square root of a number, squared, returns the same number.
- We iterate through the list to determine if by changing at most two numbers, all elements can become a perfect square.
- The `can_be_modified` function counts how many elements need changing to achieve the target perfect square.
- The main function iterates through the list of numbers and tries different root values to see if transforming into those roots' perfect squares is feasible with the allowed modifications.
