QUESTION

Certainly! Here's a combined question that integrates core concepts from the given questions:

**New Coding Question:**

Create a Python function that integrates sequence analysis, mathematical geometry, and character processing. The function should accept two inputs: a list of tuples (representing sets of numerical data) and a main string (representing either a mathematical expression or a sentence). The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **Tuple Processing:**
   - For each tuple in the list, check if the tuple contains a specific integer `k`. If `k` is present, calculate and return a sequence of cumulative sums for the tuple. If `k` is not present, compute and return the arithmetic mean of the numbers in the tuple.
   - Convert the tuple elements into strings and count the number of vowels across all converted string elements in all tuples.

2. **Main String Processing:**
   - Treat the main string as either a mathematical problem or a sentence.
   - If it contains a numeric expression indicating an angular measurement (like "30°"), calculate the arc length of the angle, assuming a circle with a fixed radius of 1 unit.
   - If it is a sentence, count the total number of vowels it contains.

3. **Integration:**
   - Combine the processed results from each tuple with the outcome of the main string evaluation.
   - The function should return a dictionary containing:
     - The cumulative sums or arithmetic means for each tuple.
     - The total number of vowels in the tuple strings.
     - Either the calculated arc length or the vowel count from the main string.

This problem synthesizes tasks such as numerical sequence processing and arithmetic calculations (drawing from Questions 1 and 2), vowel counting in strings (inspired by Questions 5 and 3), and geometric calculations for arc lengths (inspired by Question 4). This novel problem requires integrating these concepts seamlessly while maintaining clear data handling practices.
