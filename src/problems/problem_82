QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a string, a non-negative integer n, and a list of lists as inputs. The function should first put spaces between words starting with capital letters in the given string using regular expressions. Then, based on the number of words separated, perform the following steps: if the number of words is even, calculate the nth Bell number and apply a bitwise OR operation between every successive pair of results up to n; if the number of words is odd, compute the sum of all unique digits present in the column specified by n in the provided list of lists and find the factorial of this sum. Assume that the inputs are such that valid computations can be performed based on the input string processing.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we'll break down the task into the following steps:

1. **String Processing**: Use a regular expression to introduce spaces before capital letters in the input string.
2. **Counting Words**: Calculate the number of words in the processed string.
3. **Even/Odd Word Count Decision**:
   - **Even Word Count**: Compute the nth Bell number, then perform a bitwise OR operation between successive Bell numbers from 0 to n.
   - **Odd Word Count**: Sum all unique digits in the nth column of the list of lists and compute the factorial of this sum.

Now, let's implement the solution and the corresponding unit tests.

```python
import re
from math import factorial

def bell_number(n):
    # We'll use a table to calculate the Bell number
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    bell = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    bell[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        # Explicitly put the last value of the previous row in the first position of the current row
        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]
    return bell[n][0]

def solution(string, n, list_of_lists):
    # Step 1: Insert spaces before capital letters using regex
    processed_string = re.sub(r'(?<!^)(?=[A-Z])', ' ', string).strip()
    
    # Step 2: Split into words and count number of words
    words_list = processed_string.split()
    num_words = len(words_list)
    
    if num_words % 2 == 0:
        # Step 3: Calculate nth Bell number and perform bitwise OR
        bell_numbers = [bell_number(i) for i in range(n+1)]
        if n > 0:
            result = bell_numbers[0]
            for i in range(1, n+1):
                result |= bell_numbers[i]
            return result
        else:
            return bell_numbers[0]
    else:
        # Step 3: Sum unique digits in nth column and find factorial
        unique_digits = set()
        for row in list_of_lists:
            if 0 <= n < len(row) and isinstance(row[n], int):
                unique_digits.update(str(abs(row[n])))
        
        digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in unique_digits)
        return factorial(digit_sum)
```

def test_solution_even_words():
    # Example: "HelloWorld" -> "Hello World" (2 words, even)
    # n=2, Bell number up to 2: B0=1, B1=1, B2=2, OR(1,1,2)=3
    assert solution("HelloWorld", 2, [[0, 1], [2, 3]]) == 3

def test_solution_odd_words():
    # Example: "ThisIsTest" -> "This Is Test" (3 words, odd)
    # n=1, unique digits in column 1: 1, 3, factorial of the sum = 3! = 6
    assert solution("ThisIsTest", 1, [[0, 1], [2, 3]]) == 6

def test_solution_no_words():
    # String is empty, no capital:
    # Example: "" -> "" (0 words)
    # n=0, Bell number B0=1
    assert solution("", 0, [[0]]) == 1

def test_solution_single_word():
    # Example: "Single" -> "Single" (1 word)
    # n=0, column 0 has number 2 and 3, unique digits 2,3 -> factorial of 5 = 120
    assert solution("Single", 0, [[2], [3]]) == 120

def test_solution_multiple_capitals_no_word():
    # Example: "ABCD" -> " A B C D" (4 words, even)
    # n=3, Bell numbers B0=1, B1=1, B2=2, B3=5, OR(1,1,2,5)=7
    assert solution("ABCD", 3, [[1], [2], [3]]) == 7

def test_solution_invalid_n():
    # n greater than the column range in list_of_lists
    # Example: "TestInput" -> "Test Input" (2 words, even)
    # Bell number up to B1, OR(1,1)=1
    assert solution("TestInput", 5, [[1, 2], [3, 4]]) == 1
```

This implementation considers both scenarios (even and odd word counts) and includes comprehensive testing to check various edge cases.
