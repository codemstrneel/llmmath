QUESTION

Write a Python function that determines if it's possible to form a triangle with a positive area using three given angles, and if so, returns the number formed by left rotating the bits of the largest angle.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To determine if it's possible to form a triangle with given angles, the sum of the angles must be 180 degrees. Once we have validated this, the bitwise left rotation of the largest angle will be performed. Here is the solution along with the unit tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(angle1, angle2, angle3):
    """
    Determines if a triangle can be formed with the given angles.
    If yes, returns an integer formed by left rotating the bits of the largest angle.
    """
    # Check if the sum of the angles is exactly 180
    if angle1 + angle2 + angle3 != 180:
        raise ValueError("The angles do not form a valid triangle.")
    
    # Identify the largest angle
    largest_angle = max(angle1, angle2, angle3)
    
    # Rotate bits to the left of the largest angle
    # Python 'int' type is unbounded, consider only the smallest
    # significant 32 bits of it for the sake of bit operations.
    numbers_of_bits = 32
    rotated = (largest_angle << 1) & ((1 << numbers_of_bits) - 1)
    rotated |= (largest_angle >> (numbers_of_bits - 1))
    
    return rotated
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_triangle_formed_valid_angles():
    assert solution(60, 60, 60) == 120

def test_triangle_formed_different_rotation():
    assert solution(90, 45, 45) == 180

def test_triangle_formed_large_angles():
    assert solution(100, 40, 40) == 192

def test_invalid_triangle_angles():
    try:
        solution(90, 90, 10)
        assert False, "Expected ValueError"
    except ValueError as e:
        assert str(e) == "The angles do not form a valid triangle."

def test_another_invalid_triangle():
    try:
        solution(100, 80, 10)
        assert False, "Expected ValueError"
    except ValueError as e:
        assert str(e) == "The angles do not form a valid triangle."
```
<|Test End|>

This code and tests check if the angles can form a triangle and perform a bitwise rotation on the largest angle when valid. It raises an error if the angles can't form a triangle.
