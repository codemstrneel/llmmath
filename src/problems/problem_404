QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a function that processes a list of mixed data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and strings that represent positive integers. The function should:

1. Separate and sort the integers and strings (treated as integers) in ascending order. To achieve this, use a sorting method that efficiently handles two distinct types together but avoids explicitly converting the entire list to a single type before sorting.

2. For each integer and valid integer-representing string, check whether it is a prime number. Define a lambda function to determine prime status.

3. For each floating-point number, raise it to the power of its floor value (using a lambda function) and retain the result as a float.

4. Return a dictionary with two keys: `"primes"` containing a list of sorted prime integers and strings (as integers), and `"floats"` containing the processed floating-point numbers in their original order.

This problem combines the sorting aspect from Questions 1 and 2, the power concept from Question 1, the numerical transformation with lambda functions from Questions 4 and 5, and introduces a novel element of working with mixed data types (integers and floating-point numbers) from the provided problems.

def process_mixed_list(data):
    from math import floor, isqrt

    # Separate integers/strings and floats
    integers_and_strings = [x for x in data if isinstance(x, int) or (isinstance(x, str) and x.isdigit())]
    floats = [x for x in data if isinstance(x, float)]

    # Define lambda functions
    is_prime = lambda x: x > 1 and all(x % i != 0 for i in range(2, isqrt(x) + 1))
    power_floors = lambda x: x ** floor(x)

    # Sort integers and convert strings to integers
    integers_and_strings = sorted(int(x) for x in integers_and_strings)

    # Filter and collect primes
    primes = [x for x in integers_and_strings if is_prime(x)]

    # Process floats with power floor lambda
    processed_floats = [power_floors(x) for x in floats]

    return {
        "primes": primes,
        "floats": processed_floats,
