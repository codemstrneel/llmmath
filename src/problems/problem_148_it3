QUESTION

Write a function that determines if one array (array A) can be transformed into a permutation of a subset of another array (array B), such that the subset elements in array B appear in the same relative order as they do in array A. If this condition is met, return the starting index of this subset in array B. Additionally, return the count of unique elements from this subset that also appear in array A. If the condition is not met, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The function needs to be adjusted to correctly interpret the task requirement, which is not only about permutation and subset, but also maintaining the relative order of elements in array A as they appear in array B. Here's a corrected implementation, focusing on this order preservation requirement.

```python
def solution(array_a, array_b):
    """
    Determines if the sequence of elements in array_a can be found
    as a subsequence (in order) in array_b. 
    If found, return the starting index of such a subsequence in array_b and
    the count of unique elements in this subsequence that also appear in array_a.
    If the condition is not met, return -1.
    """
    len_a = len(array_a)
    len_b = len(array_b)
    
    if len_a == 0:
        return -1  # Using empty array_a doesn't make sense for defining a subset.
    
    i, j = 0, 0  # Pointers for array_a and array_b respectively
    
    while j < len_b:
        if array_a[i] == array_b[j]:
            i += 1
            if i == len_a:
                # Found all of array_a in sequence
                start_index = j - len_a + 1
                unique_count = len(set(array_a))
                return start_index, unique_count
        j += 1
    
    return -1

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_ordered_subsequence_present():
    assert solution([1, 2], [5, 1, 2, 3]) == (1, 2)

def test_solution_ordered_subsequence_at_end():
    assert solution([1, 2], [3, 4, 1, 2]) == (2, 2)

def test_solution_no_ordered_subsequence():
    assert solution([2, 3], [1, 4, 5, 6]) == -1

def test_solution_identical_arrays():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) == (0, 3)

def test_solution_b_shorter_than_a():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]) == -1

def test_solution_empty_array_a():
    # Since array_a is empty, we cannot form a valid subset.
    assert solution([], [1, 2, 3]) == -1

def test_solution_single_element():
    # Single element from array_a should be found in array_b in order.
    assert solution([2], [3, 2, 4]) == (1, 1)

def test_solution_single_element_not_in_b():
    # Single element not present
    assert solution([5], [1, 2, 3]) == -1

def test_solution_with_duplicates_in_b():
    # The duplicate doesn't affect it being a subsequence
    assert solution([1, 2], [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]) == (1, 2)
<|Test End|>
```

This implementation correctly ensures the sequence of elements in `array_a` is found as a subsequence in `array_b`, maintaining the order, and satisfies the problem's requirements with all relevant test cases.
