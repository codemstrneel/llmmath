QUESTION

Write a python function to determine whether the given number can be represented by the sum of two squares, where both squares are generated from prime numbers.

SOL & TESTS

To solve the problem of determining whether a given number can be represented by the sum of two squares, where each square is generated from prime numbers, we can use the following approach:

1. **Generate Prime Numbers**: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a list of prime numbers up to the square root of the given number. We only need primes up to this range because the prime squared should not exceed the number.
  
2. **Check Sums**: Iterate through pairs of these prime numbers, calculate the sum of their squares, and check if this sum equals the given number.

3. **Efficiency**: This approach leverages the fact that there should be limited pairs to check as both numbers are constrained by their prime status and their squared values.

The solution involves generating prime numbers, calculating sums of their squares, and checking each sum against the target number. Here's how you can implement and test it:

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def find_primes_up_to(n):
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, n + 1):
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
    return primes

def can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    
    max_prime = int(math.sqrt(num))
    primes = find_primes_up_to(max_prime)
    
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i, len(primes)):
            if primes[i]**2 + primes[j]**2 == num:
                return True
    
    return False
```

```python
from solution import can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes

def test_basic_cases():
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(13) == True  # 2^2 + 3^2
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(5) == False  # Cannot be expressed as sum of squares of primes
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(29) == True  # 5^2 + 2^2

def test_edge_cases():
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(0) == False  # Less than 2
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(1) == False  # Less than 2
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(2) == False  # 1^2 + 1^2 is not valid as 1 is not a prime

def test_large_numbers():
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(50) == True  # 5^2 + 5^2
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(85) == True  # 7^2 + 6^2

def test_no_squares_case():
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(11) == False  # Does not fit the condition
    assert can_be_expressed_as_sum_of_two_squares_of_primes(52) == False  # Doesn't work with any primes squared
```

This code solves the problem by generating necessary prime numbers and checking sums of their squares against the target number. The tests ensure the function works across various edge cases and inputs.
