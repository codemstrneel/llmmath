QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes an array and rotates it by a specified number of positions to the left. After rotating the array, identify any equilibrium indices that exist. An equilibrium index is one where the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it. If multiple equilibrium indices are found, return the smallest index. If no equilibrium index exists, return -1.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's fix the compilation error issues and reconsider the test cases based on the problem statement. The solution rotates the list and finds the smallest equilibrium index where the sum of the elements before it is equal to the sum of the elements after it. Let's also ensure that the solution and test syntaxes are correct.

Here is the corrected solution with the appropriate tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(array, positions):
    """
    Rotates the array to the left by the specified number of positions
    and finds the smallest equilibrium index.

    :param array: List[int] - the input array
    :param positions: int - number of positions to rotate the array left
    :return: int - the smallest equilibrium index or -1 if none exist
    """
    n = len(array)
    if n == 0:
        return -1

    # Normalize positions
    positions = positions % n

    # Rotate the array
    rotated_array = array[positions:] + array[:positions]

    # Find equilibrium index
    total_sum = sum(rotated_array)
    left_sum = 0

    for i in range(n):
        total_sum -= rotated_array[i]
        if left_sum == total_sum:
            return i
        left_sum += rotated_array[i]

    return -1
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_empty_array():
    assert solution([], 3) == -1

def test_no_equilibrium():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 1) == -1

def test_single_element():
    assert solution([10], 0) == 0

def test_equilibrium_at_start():
    # Rotated array is [0, 5, 1, -1]
    assert solution([1, -1, 0, 5], 2) == 2

def test_equilibrium():
    # Rotated array is [2, 2, 1, 3, 5]
    assert solution([1, 3, 5, 2, 2], 3) == 2

def test_large_rotation():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4], 1001) == -1

def test_multiple_rotations():
    # Rotated array is [10, 10, -10, 10, -10]
    assert solution([10, -10, 10, -10, 10], 2) == 2

def test_rotation_impact():
    # Rotated array is [3, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2]
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0], 3) == 3
```

Make sure to import the solution function in your test module in a real testing environment if the tests and the solution are placed in separate files. The tests should now correctly evaluate the solution based on the problem statement.
