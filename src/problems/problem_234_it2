QUESTION

New Question: Write a function to calculate the sum of the series 1³+2³+3³+….+n³, but this time also determine if the resulting sum is a perfect square.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The failure in `test_sum_of_cubes_not_perfect_square` was due to an incorrect expectation. The value 784 is a perfect square (28^2). Let's fix the test expectations correctly to ensure the tests match the correct math logic.

Here's the corrected version:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n):
    """
    Calculates the sum of cubes from 1 to n and checks if it is a perfect square.
    
    Returns:
        Tuple (sum_of_cubes, is_perfect_square): 
            sum_of_cubes is an integer, the sum of cubes from 1 to n.
            is_perfect_square is a boolean indicating if the sum is a perfect square.
    """
    sum_of_cubes = sum(i**3 for i in range(1, n+1))
    
    # To check if sum_of_cubes is perfect square
    if sum_of_cubes >= 0:
        root = int(sum_of_cubes**0.5)
        is_perfect_square = (root * root == sum_of_cubes)
    else:
        is_perfect_square = False

    return (sum_of_cubes, is_perfect_square)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_sum_of_cubes_should_return_correct_sum():
    assert solution(1) == (1, True)  # 1^3 = 1, which is a perfect square (1^2)
    assert solution(2) == (9, True)  # 1^3 + 2^3 = 9, which is a perfect square (3^2)
    assert solution(3) == (36, True) # 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 36, which is a perfect square (6^2)
    assert solution(4) == (100, True)# 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100, which is a perfect square (10^2)
    assert solution(5) == (225, True)# This sum is also a perfect square (15^2)
    assert solution(6) == (441, True)# This sum is also a perfect square (21^2)

def test_sum_of_cubes_large_n():
    result, is_perfect = solution(100)
    assert result == 25502500
    assert is_perfect == True  # Known sum is a perfect square

def test_sum_of_cubes_not_perfect_square():
    result, is_perfect = solution(7)
    assert result == 784  # 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3+ 5^3 + 6^3+ 7^3
    assert is_perfect == True  # 784 is a perfect square (28^2)

def test_edge_cases():
    assert solution(0) == (0, True)  # Zero is a perfect square (0^2)
<|Test End|>

These unit tests now accurately reflect the properties of the sum of cubes as it relates to perfect squares.
