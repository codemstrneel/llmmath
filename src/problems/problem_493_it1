QUESTION

Write a python function to calculate the sum of the first n odd natural numbers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the results of the tests, it seems that the handling of negative inputs needs to be reviewed since typically, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is only applicable for \( n \geq 1 \). Hence, calling the function with \( n = 0 \) or negative values should be handled explicitly.

Let's refine the solution and the tests to correctly handle these scenarios. If \( n \) is less than 1, we should return 0, since we can't sum a negative count of numbers.

Here is the refined solution and test cases:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(n):
    """
    Returns the sum of the first n odd natural numbers.
    An odd natural number sequence is: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
    The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n^2.
    For n <= 0, the sum is considered to be 0.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    return n * n
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_sum_of_first_n_odd_numbers():
    assert solution(1) == 1  # The first odd number is 1
    assert solution(2) == 4  # 1 + 3 = 4
    assert solution(3) == 9  # 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
    assert solution(4) == 16 # 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
    assert solution(5) == 25 # 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25

def test_zero_and_negative():
    assert solution(0) == 0  # Sum of zero odd numbers is 0
    assert solution(-1) == 0 # For negative n, sum should be 0
    assert solution(-5) == 0 # Another negative test case

def test_large_n():
    assert solution(100) == 10000  # 100^2 = 10000
    assert solution(1000) == 1000000  # 1000^2 = 1000000
    
def test_non_integer_input():
    try:
        solution(2.5)
    except TypeError:
        # Assuming the function should raise an error for non-integer input
        pass
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Expected TypeError for non-integer input")
