QUESTION

Write a Python function to find all the rational solutions of a given non-degenerate quadratic equation, if any exist.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the compilation error that occurred in our previous attempt. The error may have resulted from misplaced code blocks or syntax. Let's ensure that we redefine the solution and test sections clearly, without any syntax issues. I will also make sure the mathematical logic and function naming conventions adhere strictly to Python standards.

Here is the corrected code with a proper separation of the solution and test code sections:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def is_perfect_square(n):
    """ Helper function to check if a number is a perfect square """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

def solution(a, b, c):
    discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c
    if not is_perfect_square(discriminant):
        return []  # No rational solutions, since discriminant is not a perfect square

    sqrt_d = int(math.isqrt(discriminant))
    root1 = Fraction(-b + sqrt_d, 2 * a)
    root2 = Fraction(-b - sqrt_d, 2 * a)
    
    if root1 == root2:
        return [root1]  # Only one unique rational solution exists
    else:
        return [root1, root2]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution
from fractions import Fraction

def test_no_rational_solution():
    assert solution(1, 0, 1) == []

def test_single_rational_solution():
    assert solution(1, 2, 1) == [Fraction(-1)]

def test_two_rational_solutions():
    result = solution(1, -3, 2)
    assert Fraction(1) in result and Fraction(2) in result
    assert len(result) == 2
    
def test_negative_discriminant():
    assert solution(1, 0, 2) == []

def test_relative_primes():
    result = solution(2, -7, 3)
    assert Fraction(3, 2) in result and Fraction(1) in result
    assert len(result) == 2
```
<|Test End|>

This code defines a function for solving quadratic equations and a suite of unit tests to verify it. With this clear format, the code should compile and execute without error, assuming a proper test execution context.
