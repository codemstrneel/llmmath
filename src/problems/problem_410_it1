QUESTION

Write a function that takes a list of strings, where each string represents a URL containing a date in "YYYY/MM/DD" format, and a target integer. For each string, extract the year, month, and day from the URL using regular expressions. Calculate the sum of the year, month, and day, and check if this sum is divisible by the target integer. If divisible, modify the URL by interchanging the positions of the year and the day within the URL. Then, divide the list of modified URLs into smaller sublists, each containing n URLs, discarding any URLs that do not fit into complete sublists. Return the list of sublists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The previous implementation of the solution needs adjustment, as do the test cases, for the function to work as intended. Specifically, it seems the expected outputs in the tests assumed incorrect rearrangement results or incorrect target sums. Let's examine and correct them.

### Explanation:
1. **Objective**: Given a list of URLs containing a date in "YYYY/MM/DD" format, check for each URL if the sum of the year, month, and day is divisible by the target integer. If so, interchange the year and day, then return the URLs divided into sublists each containing `n` URLs. Discard any sublists not containing exactly `n` URLs.

2. **Common Mistake**: It appears that the expectations in some tests were actually incorrect regarding the nature of the rearranged URLs and which ones should pass the divisibility test.

### Corrections Required:
- Verify the logic that rearranges the URL only when the date's sum is correctly divisible by the target.
- Correct the reorganized URL format expectations to interchanging the year and the day.
- Ensure test cases accurately reflect valid URLs after processing. 

Here's the updated solution and test cases:
