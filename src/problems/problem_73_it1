QUESTION

Write a function that takes a camel case string representing a mix of integers and words (with words describing numbers), converts it to a snake case string, and then returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple should be the product of all the integers and the numerical values of the words, and the second element should be a list containing the column sums of these numbers from a transformed matrix. The matrix is formed by treating each word or integer as a column index in a hypothetical two-dimensional list of lists where each index represents a value of 1; ensure that you combine any overlapping indices' sum.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the solution and provide proper unit tests for it. The main goal is to parse a camel case string, convert it into snake case, calculate the product of numerical values, and derive column sums of a transformed matrix. Let's refine our approach to ensure it works correctly.

1. Adjust the regular expression to correctly split the camel case string.
2. Correctly handle both integers and word numbers, converting words to integers.
3. Fix issues related to forming the hypothetical matrix and computing column sums.

Here's the revised solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def word_to_number(word):
    """Convert a number word to an integer."""
    word_map = {
        'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4,
        'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9
    }
    if word.lower() in word_map:
        return word_map[word.lower()]
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown word: {word}")

def solution(camel_case_string):
    # Step 1: Parse camel case string
    import re
    # Use regex to split the camel case and include numbers
    split_words = re.findall(r'[A-Z][a-z]*|\d+', camel_case_string)

    # Step 2: Process them into snake case and numerical values
    snake_case = []
    numbers = []
    for token in split_words:
        if token.isdigit():
            numbers.append(int(token))
            snake_case.append(token)
        else:
            number = word_to_number(token)
            numbers.append(number)
            snake_case.append(token.lower())

    # Convert to snake_case format
    snake_case_string = '_'.join(snake_case)

    # Step 3: Calculate product of all numbers
    product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number

    # If product is still 1, it means no numbers were provided (or they're all ones)
    if not numbers:
        product = 0

    # Step 4: Calculate column sums of transformed matrix
    matrix = defaultdict(int)
    for num in numbers:
        matrix[num] += 1

    # Convert dictionary into column sums list
    if numbers:
        max_index = max(matrix.keys())
    else:
        max_index = -1  # Edge case when there's no number
    
    column_sums = [matrix[i] for i in range(max_index + 1)]

    return (product, column_sums, snake_case_string)
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_single_word():
    assert solution("One") == (1, [0, 1], "one")
    assert solution("4") == (4, [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "4")

def test_mixed():
    assert solution("TwoThree4") == (24, [0, 1, 1, 1], "two_three_4")
    assert solution("SixFour") == (24, [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], "six_four")

def test_complex_case():
    assert solution("OneTwo3Five4") == (
        120,
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
        "one_two_3_five_4"
    )

def test_edge_cases():
    assert solution("Zero") == (0, [1], "zero")
    assert solution("Zero1") == (0, [1, 1], "zero_1")
    # Edge case with large int and zero
    assert solution("SevenZeroEight") == (
        0, 
        [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
        "seven_zero_eight"
    )
    
def test_no_numbers():
    assert solution("") == (0, [], "")
```
<|Test End|>

This solution and the corresponding tests should now correctly handle the parsing, conversion, and computation tasks, as expected by the problem statement.
