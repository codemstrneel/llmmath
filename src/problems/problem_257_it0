QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and an integer `target`. The function should:

1. Calculate the number of ways the integers in the list can be used to sum up to `target`, with each integer being allowed an unlimited number of times.
2. For each integer in the list that is less than `target`, perform a specified number of right rotations on its digits. The number of rotations should be the sum of the squares of indices in the list where the integer value equals its index (fixed points).
3. Determine if any of the resulting integers from the right rotations are prime numbers.

Return a tuple containing the number of ways to reach the `target` and a list of booleans indicating whether each of the rotated integers is a prime number.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the following steps:

1. Calculate the number of ways to sum up to the target using the given integers with unlimited use of each integer. This is a classic problem known as the "coin change problem" which can be solved using dynamic programming.

2. For each integer in the list that is less than the target, we need to determine if it is a fixed point in the list. A fixed point in this context means the integer value is equal to its index in the list. The number of right rotations for such a number is the sum of squares of indices where the value in the list equals its index.

3. After performing the right rotations on this integer, check if the resulting integer is a prime number.

Finally, we will return the calculated number of ways to form the target sum and a list of booleans indicating whether each of the rotated integers is prime.

Here is the implementation in the specified format:

```python
def right_rotate(n, d):
    n_str = str(n)
    d = d % len(n_str)  # In case d is greater than the number of digits
    return int(n_str[-d:] + n_str[:-d])

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def solution(integers, target):
    # Step 1: Calculate number of ways to form the target
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for t in range(1, target + 1):
        for num in integers:
            if t >= num:
                dp[t] += dp[t - num]
    
    ways_to_form_target = dp[target]
    
    # Step 2 and Step 3: Check right rotations and primality
    prime_flags = []
    for i, num in enumerate(integers):
        if num < target:
            fixed_point_sum_of_squares = sum(idx ** 2 for idx, val in enumerate(integers) if idx == val)
            rotated_num = right_rotate(num, fixed_point_sum_of_squares)
            prime_flags.append(is_prime(rotated_num))
    
    return ways_to_form_target, prime_flags
