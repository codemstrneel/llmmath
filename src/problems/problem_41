QUESTION

Write a Python function that performs the following tasks:

1. Takes as input a triangle represented as a list of lists of numeric values and a single tuple representing the coordinates of a point in a coordinate plane. The triangle list represents a triangular matrix where each row corresponds to a level in the triangle starting with a single element at the top.

2. Calculate the absolute value of the given coordinate point, considering it as a single integer value, and use it to define a threshold. 

3. Implement a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum total path sum from the top to the base of the triangle, similar to finding the minimum path in a triangle. During traversal, treat any values within the triangle that are less than or equal to the calculated threshold as obstacles and proceed through paths with values greater than the threshold.

4. Return the minimum path sum that navigates around the obstacles, along with a message indicating whether such a path exists.

def min_path_sum_with_obstacles(triangle, point):
    """
    Finds the minimum path sum in a triangle when certain values are considered obstacles.

    Args:
    - triangle (list of lists of int/float): The triangular grid of numbers.
    - point (tuple of int): A point (x, y) in the coordinate plane to define the threshold.

    Returns:
    - tuple: (min_path_sum, message) where min_path_sum is the minimum path sum, and 
      message indicates if such a path exists.
