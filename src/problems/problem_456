QUESTION

**New Question:**

Develop a Python function that performs a multifaceted analysis involving string manipulation, integer operations, and list processing. The function should take the following arguments:

1. A paragraph as a string.
2. A list of strings (phrases).
3. A list of integers.

The function must execute the following tasks:

1. **String Task:**
   - Clean up the paragraph by collapsing consecutive duplicate consonants into a single occurrence (for example, "letter" becomes "leter").
   - Find and identify the longest sequence of identical consecutive words in the cleaned paragraph and report the word and the length of its sequence.

2. **Integer Task:**
   - For each distinct even number in the list of integers, create a list of tuples. Each tuple should comprise:
     - The even number.
     - The sum of indices of where this number appears.
     - The total count of this number in the list.

3. **Phrase List Task:**
   - Remove all digits from each string in the list of phrases.
   - Normalize each string by converting it to lowercase.
   - Determine all unique starting letters from the phrases after digit removal and normalization, excluding vowels.
   - Identify and return the starting letter that appears most frequently among these unique starting letters. If no such letter exists, return `None`.

4. **Combined Task:**
   - Count the number of times a word from the cleaned paragraph appears in both the original list of phrases after their normalization.
   - Return a list of such words.

The function should return a dictionary with the following structure:

- `longest_consecutive_word`: A dictionary capturing the longest sequence of a repeated word in the paragraph, including the word and its sequence length.
- `even_number_analysis`: A list of tuples detailing each even number and their index sum and count from the integer list.
- `most_frequent_starting_letter`: The most occurring starting letter from the list of strings or `None`.
- `common_words_count`: A list of words that appear in both the cleaned paragraph and the list of phrases after formatting.

```python
def perform_multifaceted_analysis(paragraph, list_of_phrases, list_of_integers):
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

This new question blends advanced string manipulation, integer analysis, and list processing skills, inspired by the diverse tasks presented in the given questions.
