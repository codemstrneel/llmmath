QUESTION

Write a function to rotate a given list by a specified number of items to the left direction.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Certainly! Below is the solution and the unit tests for the problem of rotating a given list by a specified number of items in the left direction.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(lst, n):
    """
    Rotates the list lst to the left by n items.
    """
    if not lst:
        return lst
    n = n % len(lst)  # Handle cases where n is greater than list length
    return lst[n:] + lst[:n]
```
<|Solution End|>
<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_rotation_normal():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

def test_solution_rotation_no_change():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_solution_rotation_full_circle():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_solution_rotation_single_element():
    assert solution([1], 3) == [1]

def test_solution_rotation_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 3) == []

def test_solution_rotation_more_than_length():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 4) == [2, 3, 1]

def test_solution_rotation_negative_rotation():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -1) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
```
<|Test End|>

Make sure to include these tests in the same environment where the function `solution` is defined to ensure they execute correctly. The tests cover various scenarios, including rotation by zero, full-length rotation, and negative rotations.
