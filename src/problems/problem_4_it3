QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of decimal numbers (with a precision of 2) and rearranges the list in ascending order. While rearranging, any two numbers with an equal number of set bits in their integer part should retain their original relative order.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It appears there were issues with the format of the code. Let's correct these and make sure the solution and tests are properly written and formatted.

We'll ensure that the function sorts the input list based on the number of set bits in the integer part of the numbers and maintains a stable sort for numbers with the same number of set bits.

Here's the corrected solution and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(numbers):
    """
    Sorts a list of decimal numbers based on the count of set bits (1s) 
    in their integer part. If two numbers have the same count of set bits, 
    their relative order remains unchanged.
    """
    # Helper function to count set bits in an integer
    def count_set_bits(num):
        return bin(num).count('1')
    
    # Create a list of tuples (count of set bits in integer part, current index, number)
    decorated_list = [(count_set_bits(int(num)), index, num) for index, num in enumerate(numbers)]
    
    # Sort the decorated list by (count of set bits, index) which establishes stability
    decorated_list.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    
    # Return the sorted numbers based on the custom logic
    return [num for _, _, num in decorated_list]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_mixed_numbers():
    numbers = [3.14, 1.62, 4.15, 2.71, 2.71]
    assert solution(numbers) == [1.62, 2.71, 2.71, 3.14, 4.15]

def test_all_same_numbers():
    numbers = [2.00, 2.00, 2.00]
    assert solution(numbers) == [2.00, 2.00, 2.00]

def test_different_set_bits():
    numbers = [3.00, 8.00, 2.00, 15.00]
    # 3 -> "11" (2 set bits), 8 -> "1000" (1 set bit), 2 -> "10" (1 set bit), 15 -> "1111" (4 set bits)
    assert solution(numbers) == [8.00, 2.00, 3.00, 15.00]

def test_single_number():
    numbers = [2.00]
    assert solution(numbers) == [2.00]

def test_no_numbers():
    numbers = []
    assert solution(numbers) == []

def test_same_set_bits_different_order():
    numbers = [5.00, 6.00, 3.00, 10.00]
    # 5 -> "101" (2 set bits), 6 -> "110" (2 set bits), 3 -> "11" (2 set bits), 10 -> "1010" (2 set bits)
    assert solution(numbers) == [5.00, 6.00, 3.00, 10.00]
```

### Explanation for Test Adjustments:
- In `test_different_set_bits`, numbers are expected to be sorted by the number of set bits.
  - 8 and 2 both have 1 set bit but 8 comes before 2 due to the original order being preserved (stable sort).
- `test_same_set_bits_different_order` ensures we maintain the original order of numbers with the same set bits.

This setup should ensure the function and its tests run as expected without any formatting or syntax issues.
