QUESTION

Write a function that finds the top k unique lists from a given list of lists, based on the minimum sum of elements within each list.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the execution environment issues, which might be due to incorrect formatting or setup of the code blocks. I'll ensure that the solution and test cases are properly formatted and syntactically correct for execution.

The task is to find the top `k` unique lists with the smallest sums in a given list of lists. Here's how to implement and test this:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(list_of_lists, k):
    # Normalize lists as tuples to get unique lists
    unique_lists = list(map(list, {tuple(lst) for lst in list_of_lists}))
    
    # Sort the unique lists by the sum of their elements
    sorted_unique_lists = sorted(unique_lists, key=lambda x: sum(x))
    
    # Return the top k lists with the smallest sums
    return sorted_unique_lists[:k]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_with_unique_lists():
    assert solution([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3]], 2) == [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

def test_solution_with_repeated_lists():
    result = solution([[1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], 1)
    assert result == [[1, 2]] or result == [[2, 1]]

def test_solution_more_k_than_lists():
    assert solution([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 6]], 5) == [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 6]]

def test_solution_with_negative_numbers():
    result = solution([[1, -2, 3], [-1, 2, -3], [0, 0, 0]], 3)
    assert result == [[-1, 2, -3], [0, 0, 0], [1, -2, 3]]

def test_solution_varied_lengths():
    result = solution([[3], [1, 2], [2, 1, 0]], 2)
    assert result == [[3], [1, 2]]

def test_solution_k_zero():
    assert solution([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0) == []

def test_solution_single_list():
    assert solution([[5, 5]], 1) == [[5, 5]]
```
<|Test End|>

These tests consider various scenarios, ensuring robustness:
- Duplicates are effectively removed.
- Lists are sorted by sum, accounting for negatives.
- Behavior is correct when `k` exceeds the number of unique lists or is zero.
- Handles lists of varying sizes and content.
