QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a Python function `process_tuples_and_clean_list` that takes a list of non-empty tuples, a nested list of strings, and an integer `threshold`. The function must perform the following operations:

1. Sort the list of tuples in decreasing order based on the sum of the elements in each tuple.
2. For each tuple, calculate the sum of its elements. If this sum is greater than the `threshold`, replace the tuple with `-1`.
3. Map each inner list of strings to its individual components, and flatten this mapped list into a single list of strings.
4. Remove strings that have an even length from the flattened list.
5. Return a tuple containing two elements:
   - A list of processed tuples (with `-1` where applicable),
   - A filtered list of strings with all even-length strings removed.

For example:

```python
def process_tuples_and_clean_list(tuples_list, nested_strings, threshold):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage:
tuples = [(3, 1, 2), (10, 12), (5, 5, 5)]
nested_strings = [['hello', 'world'], ['python', 'programming']]
threshold = 20
print(process_tuples_and_clean_list(tuples, nested_strings, threshold))
```

In this problem, you'll be combining the concepts of:
- Sorting and modifying tuples based on a calculated sum.
- Mapping and flattening a nested list of strings.
- Filtering a list based on string properties, specifically string length.
