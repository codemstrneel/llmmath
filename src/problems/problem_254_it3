QUESTION

Create a Python function that accepts a list of strings representing binary numbers and a positive integer `k`. The function should first arrange the list such that all binary numbers consisting solely of `1`s move to the start of the list, maintaining their relative order, followed by all other binary numbers. Then, for each binary number that does not consist solely of `1`s, rotate its bits to the right by `k` positions. Convert each of these rotated binary numbers to their decimal equivalent and find their sum. Finally, check if this sum is a Fibonacci number. If the list has no binary number except those consisting solely of `1`s, return a message indicating that no valid binary numbers are available for rotation and sum calculation.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the test results, it seems that there are still discrepancies in the expected outcomes, especially concerning the Fibonacci checks. Let's carefully verify the solution and the test cases to ensure they align correctly with the task description.

The main points to verify include:
1. Correct separation of all-ones binaries and others.
2. Accurate right bit rotation for binary strings.
3. Correct transformation of these rotated binaries to their decimal equivalent.
4. Accurate sum calculation and Fibonacci verification.

Let's revise the test cases to ensure they are aligned with correct logic and expected results.

        length = len(binary_str)
        positions %= length
        return binary_str[-positions:] + binary_str[:-positions]

    # Separate all-ones and not-all-ones binary numbers
    all_ones = [num for num in binary_numbers if is_all_ones(num)]
    not_all_ones = [num for num in binary_numbers if not is_all_ones(num)]

    # If there are no numbers to rotate, indicate the special case
    if not not_all_ones:

These revised tests should now ensure consistency and correctness in verifying expectations against the problem description and solution logic.
