QUESTION

Write a function that takes a string and returns a matrix. The matrix should be a square matrix (n x n, where n is the smallest integer such that n squared is greater than or equal to the length of the string) filled in a spiral order. Begin with the smallest character (based on alphabetical order) that appears more than once in the string, filling the matrix with available characters or empty strings if necessary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems like there was an issue with the format of the previous responses, leading to compilation errors. Let's address the errors and make sure that the solution and test cases are correctly formatted and logical.

The task is to create a square matrix in spiral order, where the smallest character that appears more than once is prioritized. If there is no such character, start with the smallest character. 

Let's ensure our implementation adheres to these requirements and adjust the unit tests accordingly.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(s):
    import math
    from collections import Counter

    # Step 1: Determine matrix size
    n = math.ceil(math.sqrt(len(s)))

    # Step 2: Find the smallest character that appears more than once
    char_count = Counter(s)
    repeated_chars = sorted([char for char in char_count if char_count[char] > 1])
    if repeated_chars:
        smallest_repeated_char = repeated_chars[0]
    else:
        smallest_repeated_char = None
    
    # Step 3: Sort remaining characters
    sorted_chars = sorted(s)

    # Step 4: Initialize empty n x n matrix
    matrix = [['' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

    # Step 5: Fill matrix in a spiral order
    current_list = sorted_chars.copy()
    if smallest_repeated_char is not None:
        current_list.remove(smallest_repeated_char)
        current_list.insert(0, smallest_repeated_char)

    index = 0
    row, col, direction = 0, 0, 0
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right, down, left, up

    for _ in range(n * n):
        if index < len(current_list):
            matrix[row][col] = current_list[index]
            index += 1
        else:
            matrix[row][col] = ''

        # Calculate the next position
        next_row, next_col = row + directions[direction][0], col + directions[direction][1]

        # If next position is out of bounds or already filled, change direction
        if not (0 <= next_row < n and 0 <= next_col < n and matrix[next_row][next_col] == ''):
            direction = (direction + 1) % 4
            next_row, next_col = row + directions[direction][0], col + directions[direction][1]

        row, col = next_row, next_col

    return matrix
```

Now we need to ensure that the test cases are executed without any syntax errors and correctly verify the functionality of the solution.

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_basic_repeated_start():
    # Basic test with repeated characters
    matrix = solution("abcabc")
    expected = [
        ["a", "b", "c"],
        ["a", "", "c"],
        ["b", "", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected

def test_solution_no_repeated_chars():
    matrix = solution("abcdefg")
    # No character is repeated, start with the first alphabetically sorted character
    expected = [
        ["a", "b", "c"],
        ["g", "", "d"],
        ["f", "e", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected

def test_solution_single_char():
    matrix = solution("a")
    # Only a single character case
    expected = [
        ["a", ""],
        ["", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected

def test_solution_repeated_chars():
    matrix = solution("ededrdcdr")
    # Larger test case with multiple repeated characters
    expected = [
        ["d", "e", "r"],
        ["c", "d", "r"],
        ["c", "e", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected

def test_solution_even_length():
    matrix = solution("abcdefghij")
    # Test case to ensure correct matrix size calculation
    expected = [
        ["a", "b", "c", "d"],
        ["h", "g", "f", "e"],
        ["i", "j", "", ""],
        ["", "", "", ""]
    ]
    assert matrix == expected
```
<|Test End|>

These changes should ensure that the problem is appropriately solved and tested, with correct assembly of the spiral matrix and proper verification of various cases.
