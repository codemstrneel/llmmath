QUESTION

Create a Python function `analyze_items_and_filter` that takes a list of dictionaries with numerical values, a list of lists with integer elements, and an integer `max_value`. The function must perform the following operations:

1. Sort the list of dictionaries in ascending order based on the sum of the values in each dictionary.
2. For each dictionary, calculate the sum of its values. If this sum exceeds `max_value`, replace the dictionary with `None`.
3. Compute the average of each sublist in the list of lists, and generate a new list with these average values.
4. Filter out any average values that are greater than `10` from the new list.
5. Return a tuple containing two elements:
   - A list of processed dictionaries (with `None` where applicable),
   - A list of filtered average values.

For example:

```python
def analyze_items_and_filter(dicts_list, lists_of_ints, max_value):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage:
dicts = [{'a': 5, 'b': 3}, {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 8}, {'p': 15, 'q': 10}]
lists = [[4, 6, 8], [15, 20], [3, 5, 7]]
max_value = 20
print(analyze_items_and_filter(dicts, lists, max_value))
```

In this problem, you'll be performing tasks such as:
- Sorting and modifying dictionaries based on a calculated total.
- Calculating averages from sublists.
- Filtering a list based on calculated values compared to a specified threshold.

SOL & TESTS

```python
def analyze_items_and_filter(dicts_list, lists_of_ints, max_value):
    # First, sort dictionaries based on the sum of their values
    sorted_dicts = sorted(dicts_list, key=lambda d: sum(d.values()))

    # Replace dictionaries with None if their sum exceeds max_value
    processed_dicts = [
        d if sum(d.values()) <= max_value else None for d in sorted_dicts
    ]

    # Calculate the average for each sublist
    averages = [sum(sublist) / len(sublist) for sublist in lists_of_ints]

    # Filter out average values greater than 10
    filtered_averages = [avg for avg in averages if avg <= 10]

    return (processed_dicts, filtered_averages)
