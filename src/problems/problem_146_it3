QUESTION

Write a function that takes a string and a list of lists as inputs. The function should first rotate the string to the left by the number of columns in the list of lists. Then, for each sublist, sum the ASCII values of the corresponding characters of the rotated string up to the number of elements in that sublist. Return a new list where each element is a tuple composed of the original sublist and its computed sum.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems the issue with the syntax was caused by misplaced code block markers. Let's correct this by removing unnecessary markdown syntax within code blocks.

Additionally, I'll clarify the string rotation logic to ensure we're aligning with the maximum length from any sublist within the list. The tests will also reflect these adjustments.

Let's clean this up and make sure it runs:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(s, lst):
    """
    Rotates the string `s` to the left by the maximum length of any sublist from `lst`,
    then calculates the sum of ASCII values for each sublist length of the rotated string and
    returns a list of tuples containing each sublist and its respective sum.
    """
    if not lst or not s:
        return [(sublist, 0) for sublist in lst]

    # Determine the number of columns as max length of any sublist
    num_cols = max(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)
    rotated_s = s[num_cols:] + s[:num_cols]

    result = []
    for sublist in lst:
        sublist_length = len(sublist)
        ascii_sum = sum(ord(char) for char in rotated_s[:sublist_length])
        result.append((sublist, ascii_sum))

    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_standard():
    # Maximum sublist length is 3, so the string will rotate to "defabc"
    assert solution("abcdef", [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]) == [
        ([1, 2], ord('d') + ord('e')),
        ([3], ord('d')),
        ([4, 5, 6], ord('d') + ord('e') + ord('f'))
    ]

def test_solution_empty_list():
    # Since the list is empty, should return an empty list
    assert solution("abcdefg", []) == []

def test_solution_empty_string():
    # String is empty, so all sums should be 0
    assert solution("", [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]) == [
        ([1, 2, 3], 0),
        ([4, 5], 0),
        ([6], 0)
    ]

def test_solution_single_character_string():
    # Rotate 2 times but string has only one character, ascii_sum of 'a' is 97
    assert solution("a", [[1], [2], [3]]) == [
        ([1], 97),
        ([2], 97),
        ([3], 97)
    ]

def test_solution_single_column_matrix():
    # Rotate 1 place, resulting "bcdefa" and ascii values should reflect this
    assert solution("abcdef", [[1], [2], [3]]) == [
        ([1], ord('b')),
        ([2], ord('b') + ord('c')),
        ([3], ord('b') + ord('c') + ord('d'))
    ]

def test_solution_same_length_string_and_list():
    # Rotate 4 places, string "efabcd"
    assert solution("abcdef", [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5]]) == [
        ([1, 2, 3, 4], ord('e') + ord('f') + ord('a') + ord('b')),
        ([5], ord('e')),
    ]

def test_solution_empty_sublist():
    # Rotate 2 places, resulting in "cdefab"
    assert solution("abcdef", [[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]) == [
        ([1, 2], ord('c') + ord('d')),
        ([], 0),
        ([3, 4], ord('c') + ord('d') + ord('e') + ord('f'))
    ]
```
<|Test End|>

This should now be syntactically correct and aligned with the requirements, ensuring that the tests will verify the solution against various scenarios accurately.
