QUESTION

Create a function that accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, an integer `n`, and a set of excluded values. Your task is to return a list of tuples where each tuple is composed of one integer from `list1` and one from `list2`. Each integer in a tuple should mutually raise to produce the number `n`, and neither integer in the tuple should be present in the excluded set. Additionally, the function should return a separate list representing the Fibonacci sequence up to the length of the resulting list of tuples. Utilize map and lambda functions wherever applicable. If no valid tuples exist, the function should return two empty lists.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues with the previous attempt by fixing the solution and adjusting the unit tests to ensure correct functionality. The function should check if the pairs when raised in their respective powers equal `n`, given that neither integer is in the excluded set, and create the Fibonacci sequence based on valid pair count. Here's the correct implementation and testing code.

```python
def solution(list1, list2, n, excluded):
    """
    Returns a list of tuples such that each tuple contains one integer from list1 
    and one integer from list2, that when raised to each other's powers result in n,
    and neither integer is in the excluded set.
    Additionally, returns a list representing the Fibonacci sequence up to the length of 
    the resulting list of tuples.
    If no valid tuples exist, the function returns two empty lists.

These tests are designed to cover cases with no valid results, single valid pair, multiple valid pairs, exclusion affinity, and all cases of exclusions leading to empty results. We've revised the tests for logical accuracy.
