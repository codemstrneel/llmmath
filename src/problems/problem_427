QUESTION

To create a new coding question that combines aspects of the given questions, let's focus on blending text analysis with numerical sequence operations and frequency counting. Here's a novel question that holds elements from analyzing text data (like finding subsequences), integer sequence search, and frequency analysis:

---

**Combined Question:**

Design a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of sentences and a list of integers. The function should achieve the following:

1. **Text Processing and Frequency Analysis:**
   - For each sentence, analyze and identify words that have a particular property: they must be in alphabetical order, treating each word independently (e.g., "act" is in order, "cat" is not).
   - Return a dictionary where each key is a word with this alphabetical property, and the value is a tuple containing the frequency of this word across all sentences and the index of the first sentence it appears in.

2. **Integer Sequence Processing:**
   - From the list of integers, identify distinct subsequences composed entirely of prime numbers. Each subsequence should retain the original order.
   - Among these prime-number subsequences, return the one with the maximum sum. In the event of a tie, return the subsequence that appears first.

3. **Global Frequency Analysis:**
   - Determine the most frequently occurring "alphabetically ordered" word from the text snippets, as identified in step 1, and the most frequent prime number from the integer list.
   - Return these top elements paired with their frequencies as a tuple.

The function should ultimately return a tuple containing:
- The dictionary from step 1.
- The subsequence with the highest sum from step 2.
- The tuple from step 3 with the most frequent "alphabetically ordered" word and prime number along with their respective counts.

**Example Input and Output:**

```python
sentences = ["The act of optimizing code can be fun", "Some might say cats are not in order", "Order and chaos are intertwined"]
integers = [11, 3, 5, 10, 2, 13, 17, 4, 19, 23]

result = your_function(sentences, integers)

# Expected Output:
(
  { 'act': (1, 0), 'be': (1, 0), 'in': (1, 1)}, # Example dictionary
  [11, 3, 5],  # Subsequence with maximum sum
  ('be', 1, 3, 2)  # Most frequent word and prime number with counts
)
```

This problem requires skills in text analysis, sequence detection, and frequency counting, with an added twist of conditions around sorting and prime numbers, making it challenging and integrating multiple concepts.

SOL & TESTS

Sure! Let's break down the solution into its core components and implement each part step by step. We will also provide unit tests for every aspect of this implementation.
