SOL & TESTS

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def midpoint(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """
    Calculates the midpoint of a line segment given its endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
    
    Parameters:
    x1, y1: Coordinates of the first endpoint
    x2, y2: Coordinates of the second endpoint
    
    Returns:
    A tuple (x_midpoint, y_midpoint) representing the midpoint coordinates.
    """
    x_midpoint = (x1 + x2) / 2
    y_midpoint = (y1 + y2) / 2
    return (x_midpoint, y_midpoint)
