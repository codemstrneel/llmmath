QUESTION

Given the provided set of coding questions, I will create a new question that combines core concepts from some of them. Let's focus on combining elements of tuple processing, conditional filtering based on a target, and array searching concepts.

**New Question:**

Create a Python function `process_and_search` that takes a list of non-empty tuples, a target integer, and a sorted list of unique integers. The function should perform the following operations:

1. Sort the list of tuples in increasing order based on the last element of each tuple.
2. Multiply the adjacent elements within each tuple, appending the product to each tuple.
3. Remove any tuples where the product of adjacent elements equals the target integer.
4. For each remaining tuple, search for the product in the sorted list of unique integers and return its index if found, otherwise return -1 for that tuple.
5. Return a new list of tuples where each tuple contains the original elements followed by the product and the index (or -1 if not found).

For example:
```python
def process_and_search(tuples_list, target, sorted_list):
    # Your implementation here
    
# Example usage:
tuples = [(3, 1, 2), (4, 6, 5), (7, 8, 9)]
target = 6
sorted_list = [2, 3, 4, 19, 29, 63, 72]
print(process_and_search(tuples, target, sorted_list))
```

In this problem, you'll be combining the concepts of:
- Sorting tuples by their last element.
- Computing products of adjacent elements and filtering tuples based on a target condition.
- Searching for computed values in a pre-sorted list, which involves both list traversal and handling negative results quintessential to a search operation.

    Processes a list of tuples by sorting, computing products of adjacent elements,
    filtering based on a target, and searching for products in a sorted list.

            elif sorted_lst[mid] < num:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return -1

    # Step 1: Sort tuples based on the last element
    tuples_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[-1])

    result = []
    for tup in tuples_list:
        # Step 2: Compute product of adjacent elements
        products = compute_product(tup)

        # Step 3: Filter tuples with no product equaling the target, we need to filter tuples with any product equals
        if target in products:
            continue

        # Step 4 & 5: Search each product in the sorted list and build the result tuples
        for product in products:
            index = search_in_sorted_list(product, sorted_list)
            result.append(tup + (product, index))
    
    return result
