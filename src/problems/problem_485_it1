QUESTION

New Question: Write a function that multiplies two floating-point numbers. However, if the product falls within the specified range, the function should return 50.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The test `test_solution_normal_case` failed because the expected output was incorrectly set at `10.0`, which falls within the specified range. Therefore, according to our implemented function, it should return `50` instead of `10.0`.

I'll make adjustments to the erroneous test and ensure all expectations are correctly set. Let's update and fix the test accordingly:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(x, y, lower_bound=10.0, upper_bound=20.0):
    """
    Multiplies two floating-point numbers x and y.
    Returns 50 if the product is within the range [lower_bound, upper_bound);
    otherwise, returns the actual product.
    
    :param x: First floating-point number.
    :param y: Second floating-point number.
    :param lower_bound: Lower bound of the range.
    :param upper_bound: Upper bound of the range.
    :return: Product of x and y or 50 if within range.
    """
    product = x * y
    if lower_bound <= product < upper_bound:
        return 50
    else:
        return product
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_normal_case():
    assert solution(2.5, 4.0) == 50  # Product is 10.0, should return 50

def test_solution_within_range():
    assert solution(5.0, 2.1) == 50  # Product is 10.5, within range
    assert solution(5.0, 3.9) == 50  # Product is 19.5, within range

def test_solution_on_lower_bound():
    assert solution(2.0, 5.0) == 50  # Product is 10, exactly on lower bound

def test_solution_above_upper_bound():
    assert solution(7.0, 3.0) == 21.0  # Product is above upper bound

def test_solution_below_lower_bound():
    assert solution(2.0, 4.0) == 8.0  # Product is below lower bound

def test_solution_exact_upper_bound():
    assert solution(5.0, 4.0) == 20.0  # Product is exactly the upper bound

<|Test End|>

Now, the unit tests include the correct expectations according to the specified behavior of the function. Note that when the product falls precisely within the range `[10, 20)`, it should return `50`, which is reflected in the revised tests.
