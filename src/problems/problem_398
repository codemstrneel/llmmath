QUESTION

Develop a function that accepts a list of lists and performs the following operations: First, transform each list into a dictionary where each element is paired with its index in the list as the key (assuming all elements are integers). Then, for each pair in the dictionary, multiply the value by its key. Finally, aggregate and return a single dictionary containing all the unique key-value pairs from these transformed dictionaries. Use dictionary comprehensions and the zip function to implement this.
