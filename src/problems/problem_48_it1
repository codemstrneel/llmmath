QUESTION

Write a function that takes two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, and a set of excluded values. The function should identify pairs of numbers where one number comes from `list1` and the other from `list2`, such that their product equals a specified integer `m` and neither number is found in the excluded set. Use the `map` and `lambda` functions to create a list of tuples representing these pairs. Additionally, utilize recursion to compute the Fibonacci sequence up to the length of this list of tuples. Return a dictionary where the keys are the indices of the pairs in the original lists, and the values are tuples of the pairs' product and the corresponding Fibonacci number. If no such pairs exist, return an empty dictionary.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's modify the solution and unit tests to address the failures observed during the code execution output. The key issue seems to be the calculation of pairs and possibly the Fibonacci sequence. We will ensure that our product check properly excludes values from `excluded` and correctly checks the product against `m`.

Here's the revised solution and the corresponding unit tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(list1, list2, excluded, m):
    def fibonacci(n, fib_cache={0: 0, 1: 1}):
        if n in fib_cache:
            return fib_cache[n]
        fib_cache[n] = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
        return fib_cache[n]

    pairs = list(
        filter(
            lambda pair: pair[0] * pair[1] == m,
            map(
                lambda x: (x[0], x[1]),
                [
                    (i, j)
                    for i in list1 if i not in excluded
                    for j in list2 if j not in excluded
                ],
            ),
        )
    )
    
    fib_sequence = [fibonacci(i) for i in range(len(pairs))]
    result = {idx: (pair[0] * pair[1], fib_sequence[idx]) for idx, pair in enumerate(pairs)}
    
    return result
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_no_pairs():
    # Test where no pairs can be found
    assert solution([1, 2], [3, 4], set(), 10) == {}

def test_single_pair():
    # Test with a single valid pair
    assert solution([1, 2], [4, 8], set(), 8) == {0: (8, 0)}

def test_multiple_pairs():
    # Test with multiple pairs
    expected = {0: (6, 0), 1: (6, 1)}
    assert solution([1, 3, 2], [2, 4, 3], set(), 6) == expected

def test_with_excluded_values():
    # Test with excluded values impacting the result
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], {2}, 3) == {0: (3, 0), 1: (3, 1)}

def test_fibonacci_sequence():
    # Test checks if Fibonacci is calculated correctly
    expected = {0: (2, 0), 1: (2, 1), 2: (2, 1), 3: (2, 2)}
    result = solution([1, 2], [1, 2], set(), 2)
    assert result == expected

def test_large_numbers():
    # Test with larger numbers
    assert solution([100, 200], [2, 5, 50], set(), 200) == {0: (200, 0)}
```
<|Test End|>

### Explanation:
- **Solution**: The solution iterates through the cross product of `list1` and `list2`, checks if each product matches `m`, and ensures none of the numbers are in `excluded`. Once pairs are identified, the Fibonacci sequence is computed for the indices, matching the required conditions.
- **Unit Tests**: The tests verify scenarios like no pairs, single pairs, multiple pairs, excluded values, proper Fibonacci calculation, and tests with larger values.

Adjustments to tests and logic should improve the results and ensure correctness in covering the required functionalities.
