QUESTION

Write a function that rotates a given list of strings by a specified number of positions to the left. Then, for each string in the rotated list, use regex to find and return the starting index of all occurrences of a specific substring within each string.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the issues from attempt 1:

1. **Integer Modulo by Zero Error**: This occurs because the length of the list of strings could be zero, leading to a division/modulo by zero when performing the rotation. We need to handle the case where the input list is empty before attempting to rotate.

2. **Test Failures**: The test failures need to be reassessed after fixing the modulo by zero error. Also, adjust the tests for expectations based on how rotation and substring search should behave when the list is empty or other edge cases exist.

Below is the corrected solution and revised test cases:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
import re
from typing import List, Tuple

def solution(strings: List[str], rotate_by: int, substring: str) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Rotates a given list of strings by 'rotate_by' positions to the left.
    For each string in the rotated list, finds the starting index of all 
    occurrences of 'substring' using regex.
    """
    n = len(strings)
    if n == 0:  # Handle empty list case
        return []

    # Step 1: Rotate the list of strings to the left by 'rotate_by'
    rotated_strings = strings[rotate_by % n:] + strings[:rotate_by % n]

    # Step 2: Find all occurrences of 'substring' in each rotated string
    result = []
    for string in rotated_strings:
        matches = [match.start() for match in re.finditer(re.escape(substring), string)]
        result.append(matches)

    return result
<|Solution End|>
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_rotate_and_find_substring_occurrences():
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 1, "a") == [[1, 3], [1]]
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 2, "e") == [[4], []]
    
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 0, "n") == [[], [2], []]
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 3, "a") == [[0], [1, 3]]

    # Test with empty substring
    assert solution(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], 1, "") == [
        list(range(len("banana") + 1)), 
        list(range(len("cherry") + 1)), 
        list(range(len("apple") + 1))
    ]

def test_edge_cases():
    assert solution([], 2, "a") == []
    
    assert solution(["abcd"], 1, "") == [list(range(4 + 1))]  # All positions in "bcd"
    
    assert solution(["a", "b", "c"], 5, "a") == [[0], [], []]
    
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 1, "z") == [[], []]

def test_no_occurrences():
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 1, "z") == [[], []]
    
def test_multiple_occurrences():
    assert solution(["banana", "apple", "banana"], 2, "an") == [[1, 3], [1, 3]]
    
def test_rotation_with_repeated_patterns():
    assert solution(["abc", "def", "abc"], 2, "abc") == [[0], [0]]
<|Test End|>
```

### Key Changes:
- Handled the case when the input `strings` list is empty, preventing any modulo by zero errors.
- Adjusted tests to ensure that they are verifying the solution correctly against both typical and edge-case inputs.
