QUESTION

Design a function that takes a list of floating-point numbers and returns a dictionary where each unique number is a key. The value for each key should be a tuple containing two elements: the frequency of that number in the list and the number rounded up to two decimal places. Use a lambda function to filter and derive the positive numbers in the list before processing.
