QUESTION

Write a function that accepts a list of lists, where each sublist contains numeric elements representing triangle side lengths. For each sublist, determine if it forms a valid triangle, and if so, compute the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. Return a list of the areas of valid triangles, rounded up to two decimal places.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The provided solution for calculating the area of triangles and the associated test cases look mostly correct. However, the syntax error arises from improperly including the code within the `Attempt 3 Solution`. The solution and tests need to be correctly formatted and structured to work as expected. Let's ensure that the `solution` function and its tests are correctly implemented with no syntax issues.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import math

def solution(triangle_sides):
    """
    Returns a list of the areas of valid triangles, rounded up to two decimal places.
    
    Parameters:
    triangle_sides (list of lists): A list where each sublist contains three numbers representing triangle side lengths.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the area of each valid triangle, rounded up to two decimal places.
    """
    
    def is_valid_triangle(sides):
        a, b, c = sorted(sides)
        return a + b > c

    def herons_formula(sides):
        a, b, c = sides
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        return area
    
    areas = []
    for sides in triangle_sides:
        if is_valid_triangle(sides):
            area = herons_formula(sides)
            areas.append(round(area, 2))
            
    return areas
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_empty_input():
    assert solution([]) == []

def test_solution_no_valid_triangle():
    assert solution([[1, 1, 3], [2, 2, 5], [10, 1, 12]]) == []

def test_solution_valid_triangles():
    assert solution([[3, 4, 5], [6, 8, 10], [7, 7, 7]]) == [6.0, 24.0, 21.22]

def test_solution_mixed_valid_invalid_triangles():
    # Valid triangles: [3, 3, 5] and [5, 5, 8]
    # [1, 1, 2] and [6, 10, 15] are not valid triangles
    assert solution([[3, 3, 5], [1, 1, 2], [6, 10, 15], [5, 5, 8]]) == [4.15, 12.0]

def test_solution_large_valid_triangles():
    assert solution([[30, 40, 50], [1000, 1000, 1000]]) == [600.0, 433012.7]

def test_solution_precise_area():
    assert solution([[5, 5, 6]]) == [12.0]
```
<|Test End|>

### Summary:

- Adjust the test cases to ensure they reflect accurate assumptions about triangle side validity.
- The syntax error encountered earlier likely arose from placement and formatting during the editing process. Each code block above is properly enclosed and uses correct Python syntax.
- The solution involves checking if each set of triangle sides input forms a valid triangle and then computing the area using Heron's formula if valid. The area results are rounded to two decimal places as specified.
