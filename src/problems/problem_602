QUESTION

Here's a novel coding question that integrates and expands on the core concepts from the provided questions:

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that receives the following inputs: a list of integers, and two additional parameters \( x \) and \( y \) which are integers. The function should perform these tasks:

1. **Subsequence Maximum Sum Calculation**: Identify two non-overlapping subsequences within the list of integers such that the sum of each subsequence is maximum. The subsequences must not have adjacent elements. Return the total sum from both subsequences.

2. **Equilibrium Exchange**: After determining the subsequences, convert any equilibrium index of the original list into a pair of two numbers: the number just preceding it and just succeeding it in the list (if they exist). If these numbers create a valid range (start < end), use this range to filter unique prime numbers from the list of integers, forming a new list of such primes.

3. **Prime Product Calculation**: If the length of the new list of prime numbers is greater than \( y \), calculate the sum of the square of each prime number. Otherwise, multiply all prime numbers together to get their product. Return their sum or product accordingly.

4. **Compare and Return**: Compare the total sum from the subsequences (Step 1) with the result of either the sum of squares or the product of primes (Step 3). If the subsequences sum and the prime calculation are equal, return \( x \). Otherwise, return a tuple containing the subsequences sum and the result from Step 3.

In this problem, you must effectively handle concepts of subsequence sum maximization (from Question 1), equilibrium index identification (from Question 2), and mathematical expansions involving prime numbers with decision logic based on additional parameters.

This challenge combines dynamic programming for subsequence identification, arithmetic operations, equilibrium index logic, prime number filtering, and conditional logic to provide a comprehensive test of several programming skills.
