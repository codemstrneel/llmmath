QUESTION

Write a function that processes a list of mixed data types including tuples and dictionaries. The function should:
1. Remove any empty tuples and empty dictionaries.
2. Sort the remaining tuples in ascending order based on their first element.
3. Group the non-empty dictionaries into chunks of size 'n', ensuring the function remains efficient in terms of time and space complexity for large datasets.
   
The function should return a list containing the sorted tuples followed by the chunked groups of dictionaries.
