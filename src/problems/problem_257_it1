QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and an integer `target`. The function should:

1. Calculate the number of ways the integers in the list can be used to sum up to `target`, with each integer being allowed an unlimited number of times.
2. For each integer in the list that is less than `target`, perform a specified number of right rotations on its digits. The number of rotations should be the sum of the squares of indices in the list where the integer value equals its index (fixed points).
3. Determine if any of the resulting integers from the right rotations are prime numbers.

Return a tuple containing the number of ways to reach the `target` and a list of booleans indicating whether each of the rotated integers is a prime number.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The previous test cases seem to contain some incorrect assumptions regarding the expected outcomes. Let's revise both the solution and the tests to address potential issues and ensure they correspond accurately to the function's logic.

First, let's analyze the solution's logic and fix any issues if necessary.

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def right_rotate(n, d):
    n_str = str(n)
    if len(n_str) == 0:  # Avoid rotating an empty string representation
        return n
    d = d % len(n_str)  # In case d is greater than the number of digits
    return int(n_str[-d:] + n_str[:-d])

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def solution(integers, target):
    if target <= 0:
        return (0, [])
    
    # Step 1: Calculate number of ways to form the target
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for t in range(1, target + 1):
        for num in integers:
            if t >= num:
                dp[t] += dp[t - num]
    
    ways_to_form_target = dp[target]
    
    # Step 2 and Step 3: Check right rotations and primality
    prime_flags = []
    for i, num in enumerate(integers):
        if num < target:
            # Calculate the sum of squares of fixed points
            fixed_point_sum_of_squares = sum(idx ** 2 for idx, val in enumerate(integers) if idx == val)
            rotated_num = right_rotate(num, fixed_point_sum_of_squares)
            prime_flags.append(is_prime(rotated_num))
    
    return ways_to_form_target, prime_flags
```

Now, let's write test cases that consider implementation details, ensuring the logic translates correctly to the outcomes.

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_basic_case():
    # [1, 2, 3] to form 4 can be: [1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+3, 2+2] (7 ways including other permutations)
    # Rotations for fixed points indices give 0 rotations (no indices match), so primes check based on rotation 0
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 4) == (7, [False, False, False])

def test_no_fixed_points():
    # [2, 5, 10] to form 6 can't be done with any combination
    # No rotations since no indices of integers are their values
    assert solution([2, 5, 10], 6) == (0, [False, False, False])

def test_single_element_to_target():
    # [7] makes 7 only one way with 0 rotations checking
    assert solution([7], 7) == (1, [False])

def test_large_number_rotation():
    # [2, 3, 7, 14] can form 10 in 14 ways
    assert solution([2, 3, 7, 14], 10) == (14, [False, False, False, False])

def test_no_ways_to_form_target():
    # [5, 10, 15] can never form 8
    assert solution([5, 10, 15], 8) == (0, [False, False, False])

def test_single_integer_rotation_prime():
    # [1, 2] can form 3 in 3 ways
    assert solution([1, 2], 3) == (3, [False, False])

def test_prime_detection_after_rotation():
    # [11, 13, 17] cannot form 20, prime checks with no rotation needed
    assert solution([11, 13, 17], 20) == (0, [True, True, True])
```
<|Test End|>

By testing, we can verify if the adjusted solution solves the problem as specified.
