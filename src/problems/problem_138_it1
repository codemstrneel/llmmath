QUESTION

Write a function to determine if a string is a permutation of a substring of another string, ensuring that the substring elements appear in the same relative order as they do in the larger string.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The provided solution attempts to find if a string is a permutation of a substring of another string by checking permutations in a sliding window fashion. However, the problem seems to focus more on maintaining the relative order of characters as opposed to checking permutations, which appears to be a misunderstanding between the problem statement and the proposed solution.

Let's redefine the task: we want to check if the sequence of characters in the "needle" appears as a contiguous substring in the "haystack" while maintaining the relative order, which is essentially a substring search problem.

Below is the corrected solution and unit tests reflecting the correct understanding of the problem statement.

<|Solution Begin|>

```python
def solution(needle, haystack):
    """
    Determines if a string `needle` is a substring of `haystack`
    that appears in the same relative order.
    """
    if not needle:
        return True

    needle_length = len(needle)
    haystack_length = len(haystack)

    if needle_length > haystack_length:
        return False

    # Check directly if the needle appears in the haystack
    return needle in haystack
```

<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>

```python
from solution import solution

def test_substring_present():
    assert solution("abc", "eidabcbao") == True

def test_no_substring():
    assert solution("abc", "eidboaoo") == False

def test_empty_needle():
    assert solution("", "eidciabbao") == True

def test_empty_haystack():
    assert solution("abc", "") == False

def test_long_needle():
    assert solution("abcdef", "abc") == False

def test_identical_strings():
    assert solution("abc", "abc") == True

def test_single_character_needle_haystack():
    assert solution("a", "a") == True
    assert solution("a", "b") == False

def test_case_sensitive():
    assert solution("a", "A") == False

def test_substring_at_the_end():
    assert solution("cba", "cbabcba") == True

def test_partial_substring():
    assert solution("a", "bcdabc") == True
```

<|Test End|>

In this corrected version, the solution function checks if the `needle` is a substring of `haystack` directly, maintaining its relative order inherently, as that's the definition of a substring in this context.
