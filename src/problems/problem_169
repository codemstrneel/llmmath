QUESTION

Create a Python function that combines string processing and mathematical operations with sequences. The function should achieve the following:

1. **String Validation with Regex**:
    - Take a single string as input.
    - Use a regular expression to check if the string starts with a given substring that also ends with a specific character.
   
2. **Subsequence Processing**:
    - Within the valid portion of the string (identified by the starting substring), find all possible subsequences consisting of numeric sequences within the string (separated by spaces).
    - Convert these numeric subsequences into an integer list.
   
3. **Mathematical Operations**:
    - Compute the cumulative sum of all the numbers found in these subsequences.
    - Determine the product of each subarray of the list of numbers (similar to subarrays in tuples).
    - Return a list of the products, and a dictionary that records the frequency of each unique product found across all subarrays.

4. **Space Handling**:
    - Ensure that multiple spaces between numbers in the valid portion of the string are handled correctly by reducing them to a single space, before extracting the numbers.

Example prototype:
```python
def process_string_and_calculate_products(input_string, start_substring, end_char):
    # Your implementation
    pass
```

This exercise integrates regex for substring validation, subsequence calculations similar to subarray calculations, cumulative sum operations, and handling of string formatting issues involving spaces.
