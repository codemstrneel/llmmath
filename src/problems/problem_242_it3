QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes an integer and a list of tuples as inputs. The integer represents the number of right rotations, while each tuple contains a non-negative integer. The function should perform the specified number of right rotations on the digits of each integer in the tuples, and then check if any of the resulting integers from the right rotation are perfect squares. The function should return a list of booleans indicating whether each rotated integer is a perfect square or not.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there were multiple issues related to the logic of checking rotations and their possible perfect squares. The core problem appears to be the correct generation and validation of all possible rotations up to the specified number of rotations. I identified the problem with the failed tests in the above attempts and focused on correctly implementing the solution and tests.

Let me propose a corrected solution and revise the test suite for completeness and correctness:

<|Solution Begin|>
import math

def solution(number_of_rotations, integer_tuples):
    """
    Perform right rotations on the digits of each integer in the list of tuples.
    Return a list of booleans indicating whether any rotated integer is a perfect square.
    """
    
    def is_perfect_square(n):
        """Check if a number is a perfect square."""
        if n < 0:
            return False
        root = math.isqrt(n)
        return root * root == n

    def all_right_rotations(n, rotations):
        """Generate all right rotations of the digits of the number."""
        s = str(n)
        length = len(s)
        result = set()
        for i in range(rotations + 1):
            # Perform i rotations
            rotated = s[-i:] + s[:-i] if i != 0 else s
            result.add(int(rotated))
        return result

    result = []
    for integer_tuple in integer_tuples:
        n = integer_tuple[0]
        rotated_numbers = all_right_rotations(n, number_of_rotations)
        is_perfect_square_any = any(is_perfect_square(rotated) for rotated in rotated_numbers)
        result.append(is_perfect_square_any)

    return result
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_rotations_no_perfect_squares():
    assert solution(1, [(23,), (78,), (45,)]) == [False, False, False]

def test_single_digit_numbers():
    assert solution(1, [(0,), (1,), (4,)]) == [True, True, True]

def test_immediate_perfect_square():
    assert solution(0, [(16,), (25,), (36,)]) == [True, True, True]

def test_rotation_affects_perfect_square():
    # Rotate 256 by 1 to get 625, which is a perfect square
    assert solution(1, [(256,), (3125,), (1024,)]) == [True, False, True]

def test_large_numbers_rotation():
    # Given no rotation should lead to a perfect square
    assert solution(3, [(4096,), (16384,), (10000,)]) == [True, False, True]

def test_rotations_leading_to_perfect_square():
    assert solution(2, [(1440,), (360,)]) == [True, False]

def test_no_rotations_needed():
    assert solution(0, [(1,), (0,), (4,)]) == [True, True, True]

def test_various_rotations():
    assert solution(4, [(169,), (225,), (361,)]) == [True, True, True]

<|Test End|>

This implementation more clearly defines the rotation function, ensuring it correctly processes right rotations and evaluates for perfect squares across all considered states. The tests were also re-evaluated and adjusted to ensure they reflect meaningful inputs and expected behaviors.
