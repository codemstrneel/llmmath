QUESTION

Write a function that takes a binary tree and returns a tuple containing two values: the number of leaf nodes in the tree, and the second smallest Fibonacci number corresponding to the heights of those leaf nodes. If there is no second smallest number, return `None` for that part of the tuple. Calculate Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

SOLUTION/TESTS

## Solution
To solve this problem, we need to traverse a binary tree to identify leaf nodes and determine their heights. We will then return a tuple that contains the number of leaf nodes and the second smallest Fibonacci number corresponding to these heights.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of our solution:
1. Traverse the binary tree to find all the leaf nodes and determine their heights.
2. Calculate the Fibonacci numbers for each unique height using recursion.
3. Identify the second smallest Fibonacci number from this set.
4. Return a tuple with the number of leaf nodes and the second smallest Fibonacci number (or `None` if there is no second smallest).

We will use a helper function for the Fibonacci calculation, and a recursive function to traverse the binary tree and track leaf node heights.

To start, let's implement the solution:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number recursively.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

def solution(root):
    """
    Returns a tuple with the number of leaf nodes in the tree and the second smallest
    Fibonacci number corresponding to the heights of those leaf nodes.
    """
    if not root:
        return (0, None)

    leaf_heights = []

    def dfs(node, height):
        if node:
            # If it's a leaf node
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                leaf_heights.append(height)
            dfs(node.left, height + 1)
            dfs(node.right, height + 1)

    dfs(root, 0)

    # Calculate Fibonacci numbers for unique heights
    fibonacci_numbers = set(fibonacci(h) for h in set(leaf_heights))

    # If there's a second smallest, return it, otherwise None
    if len(fibonacci_numbers) > 1:
        return (len(leaf_heights), sorted(fibonacci_numbers)[1])
    else:
        return (len(leaf_heights), None)
<|Solution End|>
```

## Unit Tests
Now, let's write unit tests to verify the correctness of our solution. 

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution, TreeNode

def test_single_node_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    assert solution(root) == (1, None)

def test_two_levels_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3))
    assert solution(root) == (2, 1)  # Heights are 1, 1 and Fibonacci for 1 is 1.

def test_complex_tree():
    root = TreeNode(1,
                    TreeNode(2,
                             TreeNode(4),
                             TreeNode(5, TreeNode(8))),
                    TreeNode(3,
                             TreeNode(6, None, TreeNode(9)),
                             TreeNode(7)))
    assert solution(root) == (4, 2)  # Leaf heights are 2, 3, 3, 3; Fibonacci numbers are 1, 2.

def test_tree_with_multiple_fibonacci():
    root = TreeNode(1,
                    TreeNode(2,
                             TreeNode(4),
                             TreeNode(5, TreeNode(8), TreeNode(9))),
                    TreeNode(3,
                             TreeNode(6),
                             TreeNode(7)))
    assert solution(root) == (5, 2)  # Leaf heights are 2, 3, 3, 3, 2; Fibonacci numbers 1, 2.

def test_no_leaves():
    assert solution(None) == (0, None)

<|Test End|>
```

These tests will check scenarios including simple trees, empty trees, and trees with different height distributions, ensuring our `solution` function handles all cases correctly.
