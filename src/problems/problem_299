QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a function that takes a string, a list of lists, and two dictionaries as inputs. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. **String Operations**:
   - Extract numbers from the string, print them, and calculate their sum.
   - Identify the longest sequence of consecutive uppercase letters.

2. **List and Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - Reverse each list within the list of lists.
   - Calculate the product of each reversed list's elements.
   - Merge the two dictionaries. If there are duplicate keys, prefer the values from the second dictionary.
   - If the sum from the string is greater than the length of the longest uppercase sequence, remove sublists where the product of elements is divisible by this sum.

3. **String Transformation**:
   - Remove any duplicate words from the string.
   - For each unique word, determine its index in the cleaned string.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Construct a string by repeating the length of the longest uppercase sequence as many times as the number of remaining sublists.
   - Return a tuple consisting of:
     1. A list of tuples, where each tuple includes a unique word and its index in the cleaned string.
     2. The modified list of lists.
     3. The merged dictionary from the two input dictionaries.

This problem is a synthesis of operations on strings, nested lists, and dictionary manipulations, requiring efficient handling of large integers and the merging of concepts across data structures.

    for word in words:

    word_indices = [(word, input_string.index(word)) for word in unique_words]

    # Task 4: Final Output
    result_string = str(len(longest_uppercase_sequence)) * len(new_list_of_lists)

    return (word_indices, new_list_of_lists, merged_dict)
