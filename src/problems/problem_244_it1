QUESTION

Write a function that processes a list of integers and a string. The function should replace each integer in the list that is a fixed point (i.e., the element where its value is equal to its index) with its left-rotated digit version. Next, split the string at uppercase letters. Finally, return a tuple containing the modified list and the list of substrings resulting from the string split. If there are no fixed points in the list, return the list unchanged but still perform the string operation.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the errors in the solution, focusing particularly on the logic for fixed points in the integer list and proper splitting of the string by uppercase letters.

Upon reviewing the test results and the solution, it appears that issues may arise from incorrect expectations or logic in either the solution or the tests. Let's fix the solution and update the tests accordingly.

### Update Plan

1. **Fixed Points**: Ensure that the solution correctly identifies fixed points and performs left rotation on them.
2. **String Splitting**: Ensure proper splitting of the string at uppercase letters.

Here is the revised solution and test suite:

<|Solution Begin|>
def rotate_left(n):
    """
    Rotates the digits of n left by one position. For example, 123 becomes 231.
    """
    if n < 10:
        return n  # No rotation is possible for single-digit numbers
    s = str(n)
    return int(s[1:] + s[0])

def solution(lst, s):
    """
    Processes a list of integers by replacing fixed points with their left-rotated versions
    and splits a string at uppercase letters.
    """
    # Process list of integers
    processed_list = [rotate_left(lst[i]) if i == lst[i] else lst[i] for i in range(len(lst))]
    
    # Split the string at uppercase letters
    from re import split
    split_string = split(r'(?=[A-Z])', s)[1:]
    
    return processed_list, split_string
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_no_fixed_points():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4], "HelloWorld") == ([1, 2, 3, 4], ['ello', 'World'])

def test_solution_with_fixed_points():
    assert solution([0, 2, 2, 3, 5], "CamelCase") == ([0, 2, 2, 3, 5], ['amel', 'Case'])

def test_solution_no_uppercase_string():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 4], "nocaps") == ([0, 1, 2, 4], ['nocaps'])

def test_solution_single_digit_rotation():
    assert solution([1, 0, 2, 3], "PascalCase") == ([10, 0, 2, 3], ['ascal', 'Case'])

def test_solution_mixed_cases_and_fixed_points():
    assert solution([0, 1, 12, 8, 4, 13], "MixedCASE") == ([0, 1, 21, 8, 4, 13], ['ixed', 'C', 'A', 'S', 'E'])

def test_solution_no_fixed_points_and_uppercase_split():
    assert solution([5, 6, 7], "SeparateTheseWORDS") == ([5, 6, 7], ['eparate', 'These', 'W', 'O', 'R', 'D', 'S'])
<|Test End|>

### Explanation:
- **String Splitting**: The split using `re.split(r'(?=[A-Z])', s)[1:]` ensures that the beginning part of the string is not wrongly interpreted as an empty string when the split occurs right before the first uppercase letter.
- **Fixed Points Check**: The solution now correctly verifies each index against the integer's value and applies rotation accordingly.

This revised code should address the test failures correctly by providing the expected outcomes.
