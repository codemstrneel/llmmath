QUESTION

Write a python function that calculates the total number of cubes of size \( k \) within a larger cube of size \( n \), if each smaller cube can be associated with a number that represents whether it is a result of a sum of two squares. The function should return a tuple where the first element is the total number of such cubes, and the second element is the sum of the indices of cubes that can be represented as the sum of two squares. The indices should be calculated in a linear order starting from 1 at one corner of the larger cube and increasing row-wise, layer-wise.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's review the problem and adjust the solution and test cases to ensure correctness. The function currently doesn't correctly compute the sum of indices that can be represented as the sum of two squares, which is why some tests are failing. I'll address this and update the function and test cases appropriately.

### Problem Review:

1. **Calculate the Number of Smaller Cubes**: The number of smaller cubes fitting into the larger cube is given by \((n // k)^3\).

2. **Sum of Indices as Sum of Two Squares**: For each index from 1 to the number of smaller cubes, check whether it can be represented as the sum of two squares. For example, checking if \( i = a^2 + b^2 \) for integers \( a \) and \( b \).

### Revised Solution

We'll ensure the sum of indices computation is correctly implemented:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n, k):
    # Calculate the number of smaller cubes that fit completely into the larger cube
    side_cubes = n // k
    num_cubes = side_cubes ** 3
    
    # Function to check if a number is a sum of two squares
    def is_sum_of_two_squares(x):
        for a in range(int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            b_squared = x - a * a
            b = int(b_squared ** 0.5)
            if b * b == b_squared:
                return True
        return False
    
    # Calculate sum of indices that are sums of two squares
    sum_of_indices = sum(i for i in range(1, num_cubes + 1) if is_sum_of_two_squares(i))
    
    return (num_cubes, sum_of_indices)
<|Solution End|>

### Revised Test Cases

Now, let's implement the test cases with correct expected values:

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_no_cubes():
    # When n < k, no smaller cubes fit completely, hence (0, 0)
    assert solution(2, 3) == (0, 0)

def test_solution_single_cube():
    # When n == k, exactly one smaller cube fits. The index 1 is 0^2 + 1^2
    assert solution(3, 3) == (1, 1)

def test_solution_multiple_cubes():
    # With n=6, k=2, the internal cube is 3x3x3, providing 27 smaller cubes
    sum_indices_known = sum(i for i in range(1, 28) if any(i == a**2 + b**2 for a in range(6) for b in range(6)))
    assert solution(6, 2) == (27, sum_indices_known)

def test_solution_with_divisible_n_k():
    # Equivalent to a 3x3x3 setup: produces 27 cubes with the same logic as above
    sum_indices_known = sum(i for i in range(1, 28) if any(i == a**2 + b**2 for a in range(6) for b in range(6)))
    assert solution(9, 3) == (27, sum_indices_known)

def test_solution_some_cubes():
    # With n=10, k=5, only 8 cubes fit
    sum_indices_known = sum(i for i in range(1, 9) if any(i == a**2 + b**2 for a in range(3) for b in range(3)))
    assert solution(10, 5) == (8, sum_indices_known)
<|Test End|>

This should handle the computation correctly and the test cases should now cover edge cases and expectations accurately.
