QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes a dictionary of string keys and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: two integers and a list of strings. The function should perform the following operations:

1. **Regular Expression Matching and String Processing:**
   - For each key-value pair in the dictionary, use the key as a regular expression pattern.
   - Apply this pattern to determine if it matches the beginning of any string in the list of strings from the tuples.
   - For each matching string, remove all consecutive duplicate characters and additionally convert sequences of digits (0-9) into their corresponding English word representations (e.g., "123" becomes "one two three").

2. **String Length Calculation and Grouping:**
   - Calculate the length of each cleaned string after processing.
   - Group the strings by the count of unique vowels in each cleaned string, which is then taken modulo a given integer `p`, provided as input.

3. **Tuple Evaluation and Output Generation:**
   - For each group, count the number of tuples where at least one cleaned string ends in an alphanumeric character.
   - Determine the evenness or oddness of the number of such qualifying strings within each group based on their divisor count and store a boolean value (`True` for even, `False` for odd).
   - Find the tuple where the sum of the first two integer elements is the highest and includes a string with more characters that do not repeat consecutively.

4. **Return:**
   - A dictionary where each key is the group identifier (the modulo result), and each value is a tuple containing:
     - The number of tuples containing strings ending with an alphanumeric character.
     - The boolean indicating the evenness or oddness of those counts.
     - The sum of the first two integers from the tuple identified in the previous step.

Example:

Given the dictionary `{'key': [(2, 3, ['key123', 'hello']), (4, 5, ['test', 'keyagain']), (6, 9, ['begin', 'keychain'])]}` and `p = 3`, the function should output a dictionary with results based on the described logic. This question blends concepts of regular expressions, string transformations, modular arithmetic, and tuple processing.

SOL & TESTS

To address the problem, I'll implement a function that handles the operations described in the task using regular expressions and various string manipulations. Then, I'll proceed to generate a series of unit tests using `pytest` style to validate the implementation of the function.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the solution and test implementation in markdown format, encapsulated properly as specified:

```python
import re
from num2words import num2words

def process_and_group_strings(input_dict, p):
    def process_string(s):
        # Remove consecutive duplicates
        s = re.sub(r'(.)\1+', r'\1', s)
        # Convert digits to words
        s = re.sub(r'\d', lambda x: num2words(int(x.group())), s)
        return s

    def ends_in_alphanumeric(s):
        return s[-1].isalnum()

    result = {}
    
    for key, tuples in input_dict.items():
        grouped_strings = {}
        
        for a, b, strings in tuples:
            for original_s in strings:
                if re.match(key, original_s):
                    processed_s = process_string(original_s)
                    vowel_count = len(set(re.findall(r'[aeiou]', processed_s)))
                    group_key = vowel_count % p
                    
                    if group_key not in grouped_strings:
                        grouped_strings[group_key] = {'strings': [], 'tuples': []}
                    
                    grouped_strings[group_key]['strings'].append(processed_s)
                    grouped_strings[group_key]['tuples'].append((a, b, original_s))
        
        for group_key, data in grouped_strings.items():
            alnum_count = sum(1 for s in data['strings'] if ends_in_alphanumeric(s))
            max_tuple = max(data['tuples'], key=lambda t: (t[0] + t[1], len(set(t[2]))))
            result[group_key] = (
                alnum_count,
                alnum_count % 2 == 0,
                max_tuple[0] + max_tuple[1]
            )

    return result
```

    }
    expected_output = {2: (3, False, 11)}
    assert process_and_group_strings(input_data, 3) == expected_output

def test_all_strings_no_alnum_end():
    input_data = {
        'pattern': [(2, 3, ['test!', '!test', 'end.'])]
    }
    expected_output = {}
    assert process_and_group_strings(input_data, 3) == expected_output
```
<|Test End|>

These tests cover several cases, including simple cases, cases where no string matches the key, different modulo groupings, and ensuring the function handles the case where no string ends with an alphanumeric character. Each test is implemented to assert that the function behaves as expected and is resilient to edge cases.
