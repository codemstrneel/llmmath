QUESTION

Create a Python function `simplify_tuples_and_single_list` that takes a list of non-empty tuples and a list of strings. The function must perform the following operations:

1. Sort the list of tuples in decreasing order based on the maximum element in each tuple.
2. Replace any tuple where the maximum element is greater than a specified limit with `0`.
3. Remove strings from the list that have a length greater than 5.
4. Return a tuple containing two elements:
   - A list of processed tuples (with `0` where applicable),
   - A filtered list of strings with items longer than 5 characters removed.

For example:

```python
def simplify_tuples_and_single_list(tuples_list, string_list, limit):
    # Your implementation here

# Example usage:
tuples = [(1, 4, 2), (6, 8), (3, 3, 3)]
strings = ['flower', 'pet', 'pattern', 'loop']
limit = 7
print(simplify_tuples_and_single_list(tuples, strings, limit))
```

In this problem, you'll be combining the concepts of:
- Sorting and modifying tuples based on their maximum element.
- Filtering a list based on string properties, specifically string length.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def simplify_tuples_and_single_list(tuples_list, string_list, limit):
    """
    Simplifies the list of tuples and list of strings based on the given rules.

    Parameters:
    tuples_list (list): A list of non-empty tuples to be processed.
    string_list (list): A list of strings to be processed.
    limit (int): The threshold limit to decide tuple replacement.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
           - A list of processed tuples where tuples with a maximum element greater than the limit are replaced with 0.
           - A list of strings with strings longer than 5 characters removed.

    # Replace any tuple where the maximum element is greater than limit with 0
    processed_tuples = [0 if max(tup) > limit else tup for tup in sorted_tuples]

    # Remove strings from the list that have a length greater than 5
    filtered_strings = [s for s in string_list if len(s) <= 5]

    # Return the processed tuples and filtered strings
