QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of strings, a list of integer tuples, and a single string. The function should:

1. Concatenate the given single string to each element in the list of strings using a lambda function.
2. Add the list of concatenated strings to a new list along with the given list of integer tuples.
3. Calculate the frequency of each element in this new combined list.
4. Return the elements with the two highest frequencies in descending order of frequency. In case of a tie, order the elements themselves in ascending lexicographical or numerical order as appropriate.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Here is the solution to the problem with its corresponding unit tests.

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(strings, tuples, single_string):
    """
    Concatenates `single_string` to each element in `strings`, combines the result with `tuples`,
    and returns the two elements with the highest frequencies, resolving ties by element order.
    """
    # Concatenate single_string to each element in strings using a lambda and map
    concatenated_strings = list(map(lambda s: s + single_string, strings))
    
    # Combine concatenated strings and tuples
    combined_list = concatenated_strings + list(tuples)
    
    # Count frequency of each item
    frequency = {}
    for item in combined_list:
        if item in frequency:
            frequency[item] += 1
        else:
            frequency[item] = 1
    
    # Create a sorted list of items based first on frequency and then on item itself for tiebreaks
    sorted_items = sorted(frequency.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    
    # Return the two items with the highest frequencies
    return [item for item, freq in sorted_items[:2]]

<|Test End|>

The solution provided concatenates the given single string to each element of the list of strings using the map and lambda functions. It then combines these concatenated strings with the list of integer tuples. The code determines the frequency of each item in the combined list, sorts the items based on frequency in descending order (and lexicographically/tie-breaking where applicable), and selects the top two items.
