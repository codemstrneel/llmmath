QUESTION

Create a function that identifies the top k lists from a provided list of lists, based on the sum of unique prime numbers. If a list in the input contains fewer than two elements after filtering out non-prime numbers, exclude it from the result.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's refine the solution to correctly handle the requirement of identifying the top `k` lists based on the sum of unique prime numbers. We'll also ensure the test cases are consistent with the updated solution logic.

<|Solution Begin|>
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_sum(lst):
    """Return the sum of unique prime numbers in the list."""
    return sum(set(filter(is_prime, lst)))

def solution(input_list, k):
    """
    Returns the top k lists from the input list of lists, sorted by the sum of unique prime numbers in each list.
    Lists with fewer than two prime numbers are excluded.
    """
    prime_filtered = [
        (lst, prime_sum(lst))
        for lst in input_list
        if len(set(filter(is_prime, lst))) >= 2
    ]
    prime_filtered.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [lst for lst, _ in prime_filtered[:k]]

        [13, 17, 19],

    assert solution([[2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5], [7, 11, 3], [11, 13]], 3) == [

    assert solution([], 3) == [], "Test case 8 failed"

def test_edge_cases():
    # Testing with k = 0
    assert solution([[2, 3, 5, 7]], 0) == [], "Edge case test 1 failed"
    
    # Testing with a single element list
    assert solution([[11, 13]], 1) == [[11, 13]], "Edge case test 2 failed"
    
    # Testing with single non-prime element lists
    assert solution([[4, 4], [4]], 1) == [], "Edge case test 3 failed"

def test_duplicate_primes():
    assert solution([[2, 2, 3, 3], [7, 7, 11]], 2) == [[7, 7, 11], [2, 2, 3, 3]], "Duplicates in prime lists test failed"

These adjustments ensure that the tests correctly match the behavior expected from the provided solution, verifying the sorting of lists based on unique prime sums and handling edge cases properly.
