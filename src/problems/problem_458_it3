QUESTION

Write a function that generates all sublists of a given list and then creates a square matrix filled with elements from each sublist summed together, in spiral order, starting from the top-left corner of the matrix.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the syntax issue and ensure that the solution and the tests are properly formatted in the code sections. The error you're encountering might be due to incorrect handling of the code blocks, which can be fixed by ensuring proper Python syntax without extraneous symbols that can cause syntax errors. 

Here's a corrected version of the code, ensuring it is `pytest` compatible and syntactically correct:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(arr):
    def generate_sublists(lst):
        sublists = []
        for start in range(len(lst)):
            for end in range(start + 1, len(lst) + 1):
                sublists.append(lst[start:end])
        return sublists

    def spiral_fill(arr, n):
        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        start_row, end_row = 0, n - 1
        start_col, end_col = 0, n - 1
        index = 0
        
        while start_row <= end_row and start_col <= end_col:
            for col in range(start_col, end_col + 1):
                matrix[start_row][col] = arr[index]
                index += 1
            start_row += 1
            
            for row in range(start_row, end_row + 1):
                matrix[row][end_col] = arr[index]
                index += 1
            end_col -= 1
            
            if start_row <= end_row:
                for col in range(end_col, start_col - 1, -1):
                    matrix[end_row][col] = arr[index]
                    index += 1
                end_row -= 1
            
            if start_col <= end_col:
                for row in range(end_row, start_row - 1, -1):
                    matrix[row][start_col] = arr[index]
                    index += 1
                start_col += 1

        return matrix

    # Step 1: Generate sublists
    sublists = generate_sublists(arr)
    sublists_sums = [sum(sublist) for sublist in sublists]

    # Step 2: Calculate the size of the square matrix
    n = 0
    while n * n < len(sublists_sums):
        n += 1

    # Ensure we have enough elements to fill the square matrix, pad with zero if necessary
    sublists_sums.extend([0] * ((n * n) - len(sublists_sums)))

    # Step 3: Fill matrix in spiral order
    return spiral_fill(sublists_sums, n)
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_generate_sublists_empty():
    # When the input is empty, the output should be a 1x1 matrix with a zero
    assert solution([]) == [[0]] 
    
def test_single_element():
    # Verify for a single element that it fills a 1x1 matrix
    assert solution([1]) == [[1]]

def test_two_elements():
    # With two elements, verify the expected spiral filling
    expected = [[1, 3], 
                [0, 2]]  # 2x2 matrix
    assert solution([1, 2]) == expected

def test_three_elements():
    # Three elements should lead to 3x3 matrix
    expected = [[1, 3, 6],
                [0, 0, 5],
                [4, 3, 2]]
    assert solution([1, 2, 3]) == expected

def test_with_zeros():
    # Test handling list with zeros
    expected = [[0, 0, 0],
                [0, 0, 0],
                [0, 0, 1]]
    assert solution([0, 0, 1]) == expected

def test_four_elements():
    # For four elements, expect a 3x3 matrix
    expected = [[1, 3, 6],
                [0, 0, 10],
                [10, 9, 4]]
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4]) == expected
```
<|Test End|>

These changes should address the syntax issues and ensure the execution environment can run the solution and tests correctly. This setup avoids any formatting characters that aren't needed and ensures `pytest` can recognize the test functions correctly.
