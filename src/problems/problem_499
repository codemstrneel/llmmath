QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a list of tuples and an integer `k`. Each tuple contains two integer elements. Your task is to reverse the segments of the list of tuples up to position `k` and check if the reversed segment contains pairs of tuples that are identical. If a pair of tuples is identical, join these tuples into a single tuple. Additionally, verify if the corresponding elements of these joined tuples form an arithmetic sequence. Return the count of such pairs where both conditions hold.

For example, given the input list of tuples `[(2, 3), (5, 2), (2, 3), (5, 2), (4, 1)]` and position `k = 4`, the segment up to position `4` is `[(2, 3), (5, 2), (2, 3), (5, 2)]`, which when reversed becomes `[(5, 2), (2, 3), (5, 2), (2, 3)]`.

The pairs of identical tuples in the reversed segment are `((5, 2), (5, 2))` and `((2, 3), (2, 3))`. After joining, these become `(5, 2)` and `(2, 3)`, which do not form an arithmetic sequence when elements of each tuple are considered independently as sequences (`5, 2` and `2, 3` are not arithmetic). Therefore, the function should return `0`.
