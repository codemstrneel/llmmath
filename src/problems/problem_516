QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of integer tuples and an integer \( n \) and returns a new list according to the following transformations:

1. **Filtering Stage:** Remove any tuple that includes a negative integer.
2. **Transformation Stage:** For each remaining tuple, increase each integer value by 1 if the sum of the tuple is divisible by \( n \).
3. **Chunking and Reordering Stage:** Split the list of transformed tuples into chunks of size \( n \). Within each chunk, reorder the tuples based on the product of their original values, placing tuples with higher products first.
4. **Final Aggregation Stage:** For each chunk, return the maximum length of the tuples within that chunk, along with the reordered tuples.

This question integrates the following concepts:

- **Clearing or resetting values** has been replaced with increasing integer values.
- **Filtering logic** based on specific conditions remains similar.
- **Chunking** operations are retained with a new condition for reordering.
