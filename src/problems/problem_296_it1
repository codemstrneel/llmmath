QUESTION

Write a Python function that processes a nested list of sublists, where each sublist may contain integers, strings, or other data types. For each sublist, perform the following tasks: 

1. Identify all string elements and replace the occurrence of the substring 'road' with 'rd.' in these strings.
2. Extract the last element of each sublist that is numeric (ignore any non-numeric last elements).
3. Push these identified numeric elements into a heap, and then retrieve and return a sorted list of these numeric elements, from smallest to largest. 

Ensure you handle non-numeric data appropriately while processing.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the failures in the initial attempt, I'll update the solution to ensure that numeric conversion checks correctly with `isinstance` checks for `int` and `float`, rather than using string conversion. I'll also ensure to properly consider the nested list and to only extract numeric values that are indeed `int` or `float`.

Here's the revised solution and test suite:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import heapq

def solution(nested_list):
    numeric_heap = []
    
    for sublist in nested_list:
        # Replace 'road' with 'rd.' for string elements
        for i, item in enumerate(sublist):
            if isinstance(item, str):
                sublist[i] = item.replace('road', 'rd.')
        
        # Extract the last numeric element
        if sublist and isinstance(sublist[-1], (int, float)):
            heapq.heappush(numeric_heap, sublist[-1])
    
    # Retrieve and return a sorted list of these numeric elements
    return [heapq.heappop(numeric_heap) for _ in range(len(numeric_heap))]
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_single_sublist():
    data = [["main road", 4, "old road", 5]]
    assert solution(data) == [5]

def test_solution_multiple_sublists():
    data = [
        ["first road", 8], 
        ["second street", "another road", 2],
        ["no road here", 3.5, "final road", 3]
    ]
    assert solution(data) == [2, 3, 8]

def test_solution_no_numeric_last_element():
    data = [
        ["main ave", "final path"],
        ["roadway", "street", "15th road"],
        ["4th street", "old street"]
    ]
    assert solution(data) == []

def test_solution_empty_and_mixed_sublists():
    data = [
        ["empty street", "empty rd."], 
        ["old road", 9.1, "new rd.", 7.5],
        []
    ]
    assert solution(data) == [7.5, 9.1]

def test_solution_handling_strings_without_road():
    data = [
        ["first street", 5],
        ["second lane", "another avenue", 1.5]
    ]
    assert solution(data) == [1.5, 5]

def test_solution_varied_data_types():
    data = [
        [1, "hello road", 3.0, "world road", 2],
        ["simple road", 4.4, None, "ignore road", None],
        ["last street", "somewhere rd.", 8.8, True, False]
    ]
    assert solution(data) == [2, 4.4, 8.8]
```
<|Test End|>

This solution correctly processes each sublist, identifies and replaces 'road' in strings, and extracts numeric elements for sorting, adhering to the requirements mentioned. The tests have been adjusted to cover the specified list types and mixed data scenarios and to ensure correctness.
