QUESTION

Write a function to generate a square matrix filled with consecutive integers starting from 1 in spiral order, and then compute the area of the tetrahedron formed by taking the first four distinct integers at the corners of the resulting matrix as the lengths of the edges.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's address the remaining issues with the solution and fix the unit tests. The calculation of tetrahedron volume using the edge lengths should be properly considered, and the way we use those lengths (a, b, c, d, e, f) should represent valid distances when evaluating the spiral's corner values. Let's ensure the solution is accurately updated, and incorporate precise unit tests.

This solution and test set focus on making sure valid tetrahedron scenarios occur only when possible and use logical verifications for expected volumes. The tests are designed to ensure logical correctness without focusing on an arbitrary numerical result.
