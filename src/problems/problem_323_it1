QUESTION

Write a function to perform chunking of tuples each of size n, ensuring that the sum of elements in each chunk does not exceed a given threshold t.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The main issue seems to be a discrepancy between the function name and the way it's being imported in the tests. The solution is named `chunk_tuples`, but the import statement mistakenly tries to import a function named `solution`. Let's fix the test imports and ensure you have correct and comprehensive test coverage.

Here's the corrected version:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def chunk_tuples(tuples, n, t):
    """
    Splits the given list of tuples into smaller chunks of size `n`. Each chunk should ensure that the sum 
    of its elements does not exceed the given threshold `t`.

    Args:
    tuples (list): List of tuples containing integers.
    n (int): Number of elements in each chunk.
    t (int): Maximum sum of elements within each chunk.

    Returns:
    list: A list of chunks where each chunk is a list of tuples.
    """
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_sum = 0

    for tup in tuples:
        tup_sum = sum(tup)
        if len(current_chunk) < n and current_sum + tup_sum <= t:
            current_chunk.append(tup)
            current_sum += tup_sum
        else:
            if current_chunk:
                chunks.append(current_chunk)
            current_chunk = [tup]
            current_sum = tup_sum

    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(current_chunk)

    return chunks
```

<|Test End|>

This code resolves the import issue by correctly importing `chunk_tuples` and enhances the test cases for improved verification without assuming an improvised test framework or helper structure beyond standard pytest conventions.
