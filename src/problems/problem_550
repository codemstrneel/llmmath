QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that processes a list of strings combined with integer tuples and a specified integer \( n \). Address the following steps involving filtering, transformation, grouping, and aggregation:

1. **Filtering Stage:**
   - Remove any string that begins with a lowercase letter.
   - Exclude any tuples that contain a negative integer or any string that represents a negative number.

2. **Length Calculation and Duplication:**
   - Calculate the sum of the lengths of the remaining strings.
   - Identify and remove any duplicate tuples by preserving only one instance of them.

3. **Alphabetical and Lexicographical Transformation:**
   - For each string, remove all non-alphabetic characters and convert the string to uppercase.
   - For tuples, sort their elements in ascending order.

4. **Chunking and Analysis:**
   - Divide the cleaned strings and sorted tuples into chunks of size \( n \).
   - For each chunk, compute the length of the longest string and the sum of the minimum elements in each tuple.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Exclude any chunk where all strings have an odd length or if all tuples have identical sums of elements.
   - Return a list of tuples containing the results of each chunk: the length of the longest string and the computed sum for tuples.

**Example:**
Given the list `["hello", "World!", (3, 4, 9), "Test", "123abc!", (2, -1), (3, 3, 3), "apple"]` and \( n = 3 \), the function should filter strings and tuples, process them according to transformations, divide them into chunks, and exclude specific chunks based on the final output criteria.

---

**Explanation of Combos:**

- **Filtering based on conditions:** Inspired by Questions 1 and 5, with string filtering and removal of negative numbers from tuples.
- **Combination of string and tuple transformation:** Integrates elements from Questions 3 and 5 by handling both strings and tuples and applying operations like removal of non-alphabetic characters and sorting.
- **Duplication detection and handling:** Draws from Question 5 to manage duplicates in tuples.
- **Complex chunk processing:** Inspired by Questions 2 and 5, the problem requires organizing data into chunks and calculates values depending on conditional rules guiding exclusions and transformations, offering a layered challenge.

```python
def process_data(strings_and_tuples, n):
    # Step 1: Filtering Stage
    filtered_strings = [s for s in strings_and_tuples if isinstance(s, str) and s and s[0].isupper() and all(c.isdigit() == False for c in s)]
    filtered_tuples = [t for t in strings_and_tuples if isinstance(t, tuple) and all(isinstance(x, int) and x >= 0 for x in t)]

    # Remove duplicate tuples while preserving order
    seen_tuples = set()
    unique_tuples = []
    for t in filtered_tuples:
        if t not in seen_tuples:
            seen_tuples.add(t)
            unique_tuples.append(t)
    
    # Step 2: Length Calculation and Duplication
    sum_of_lengths = sum(len(s) for s in filtered_strings)

    # Step 3: Alphabetical and Lexicographical Transformation
    cleaned_strings = [''.join(filter(str.isalpha, s)).upper() for s in filtered_strings]
    sorted_tuples = [tuple(sorted(t)) for t in unique_tuples]

    # Step 4: Chunking and Analysis
    results = []
    for i in range(0, len(cleaned_strings), n):
        strings_chunk = cleaned_strings[i:i+n]
        tuples_chunk = sorted_tuples[i:i+n]

        if not strings_chunk and not tuples_chunk:
            continue

        # Calculate the length of the longest string in the chunk
        longest_string_length = max((len(s) for s in strings_chunk), default=0)
        
        # Calculate sum of the minimum elements in each tuple in the chunk
        min_sum = sum(min(t) for t in tuples_chunk)

        # Step 5: Final Output Conditions
        # Exclude a chunk where all strings have an odd length
        if all(len(s) % 2 != 0 for s in strings_chunk):
            continue
        
        # Exclude a chunk where all tuples have identical sums
        tuple_sums = {sum(t) for t in tuples_chunk}
        if len(tuple_sums) == 1 and len(tuples_chunk) > 0:
            continue

        results.append((longest_string_length, min_sum))

    return results
