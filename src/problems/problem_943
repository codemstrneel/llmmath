QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a mix of nested data structures composed of strings, integers, and RGB color tuples. The function must accomplish the following tasks:

1. Remove any tuple from the nested structures if it is empty or contains only elements specified in an input list of undesired elements. Additionally, if the tuple contains RGB color values that, when converted to HSV, fall under a specified range for each component, remove those tuples as well.

2. After cleaning, find the tuple with the largest sum of unique integers, ensuring that no two consecutive integers can be included in this sum within any tuple.

3. For the tuple identified in the previous step, isolate subsequences of characters such that each subsequence is a palindrome and only includes characters that are part of valid English words (which you should determine from a provided list of valid words). Collect these subsequences into a list.

4. Return a dictionary with these keys:
   - "Cleaned Tuples": The list of tuples after removing undesired elements and RGB-constrained tuples.
   - "Max Sum Tuple": The tuple with the optimal sum of unique and non-consecutive integers.
   - "Palindromic Subsequences": The list of character subsequences that meet the palindrome condition and English word validity.

This question combines nested data structure manipulation, digital color space conversion, consecutive element constraints, and character and word analysis tasks for a comprehensive problem-solving exercise.
