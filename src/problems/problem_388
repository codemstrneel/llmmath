QUESTION

**New Question:**

Write a function that performs a one-pass transformation on a list of strings, each representing a floating-point number ("0", "1", and "2" only) and an integer multiplier `m`. Your function should:

1. Convert each string in the list to its numeric form.
2. Sort the list assuming the numbers could only be 0.0, 1.0, or 2.0 without using any sorting algorithm or additional data structures beyond a few constant variables. Use the idea of sorting from a given format, similar to a known sorting problem, but adapted to floats.
3. For each number, calculate its cube if it's odd, and square if it's even. Use a lambda function for this conversion.
4. Multiply each result by the integer `m`.
5. Convert each product to an integer and return the resulting list of integers.

This problem combines the sorting idea from question 1 with the conversion and mathematical transformation ideas from questions 2 and 4, creating a novel problem that tests both sorting and numerical transformations.

SOL & TESTS

```python
def transform_and_process_floats(strings, m):
    """
    Transforms a list of strings representing floating-point numbers ('0', '1', '2') to integers.
    The list is 'sorted' without a sorting algorithm, converted by squaring even numbers,
    or cubing odd numbers, and then multiplied by m and returned as integers.

    Args:
    - strings: List[str], List of strings that are either '0', '1', or '2'.
    - m: int, Multiplier for the final transformation results.

    Returns:
    - List[int], Transformed list as described above.
    """
    # Convert strings to floating-point numbers
    numbers = list(map(float, strings))

    # Counters for occurrences of each number
    count_0 = count_1 = count_2 = 0
    
    # Count occurrences of each 'number'
    for num in numbers:
        if num == 0.0:
            count_0 += 1
        elif num == 1.0:
            count_1 += 1
        elif num == 2.0:
            count_2 += 1

    # Define the lambda function for conditional transformation
    transform = lambda x: x ** 3 if x % 2 == 1 else x ** 2

    # Create the 'sorted' list by flattening the 'counts'
    sorted_numbers = [0.0] * count_0 + [1.0] * count_1 + [2.0] * count_2
    
    # Apply the transformation and multiplication by m
    result = [int(transform(num) * m) for num in sorted_numbers]
