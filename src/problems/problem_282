QUESTION

Write a function to find the area of a rhombus, and optimize it to handle very large integer inputs for the diagonals efficiently.

SOL & TESTS

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def area_of_rhombus(diagonal1, diagonal2):
    """
    Returns the area of a rhombus given the lengths of its diagonals.

    The formula to calculate the area of a rhombus is:
    Area = (d1 * d2) / 2
    where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.
    
    This implementation efficiently handles very large integers.
    """
    return (diagonal1 * diagonal2) // 2
