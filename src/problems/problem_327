QUESTION

Here's a novel coding question that combines core concepts from the given questions:

**New Question:**

Create a Python function that takes two inputs:

1. A list of mixed data types, where each item is either:
   - A dictionary with the structure: `{"student": "name", "scores": [list_of_integers]}`
   - A tuple consisting of strings: `(string1, string2, string3, ...)`
   - An integer representing a year
   - A list of integers

2. A dictionary representing a linear equation in the form \((m, b)\), where `m` is the slope and `b` is the y-intercept.

The function should accomplish the following tasks:

1. For dictionaries:
   - Sort by the sum of the integers in the "scores" list.
   - From the sorted dictionaries, extract information from the top 3 based on their score sums:
     - Count the unique integers in their scores.
     - Form a concatenated string of their names and count the number of times the character 'e' appears.
   - Return these counts.

2. For tuples:
   - Count the number of unique strings and check if these can be sorted lexicographically.
   - Return a list of boolean values indicating whether each tuple can be sorted in this manner.

3. For integers:
   - Convert the year to its corresponding Chinese zodiac sign, and check if the year is a leap year. Append "(Leap Year)" if it is.
   - Return a list of these formatted strings.

4. For lists of integers:
   - Concatenate all lists and map each unique integer to its y-value calculated from the provided linear equation \((m, b)\).
   - Return a dictionary where each unique integer from the lists is a key and its value is the corresponding y-value.

The function should return a dictionary with the following keys and structure:
- `"students"`: A tuple with the count of unique integers and the count of 'e' occurrences.
- `"tuples"`: A list of booleans indicating if each tuple's strings can be sorted lexicographically.
- `"years"`: A list of formatted strings indicating the zodiac sign and leap year status for each year.
- `"mapped_values"`: A dictionary mapping unique integers to their y-values using the linear equation.

This new question merges concepts such as sorting, handling complex data types, string and integer manipulation, processing lists of dictionaries, and applying mathematical operations using a linear equation.
