QUESTION

New Question:

Write a function that processes a string while considering a complementary list of tuples, combining techniques from the provided questions:

The function should take two inputs:
1. A string `text` that may contain multiple spaces, sequences of digits, and a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters.
2. A list of tuples `tuples_list`, each containing non-empty tuples with elements that may include None values.

The task is to perform the following steps:

1. **String Processing**:
   - Replace sequences of digits in `text` with their corresponding word representation.
   - Trim it to ensure no multiple spaces are present.
   
2. **Tuple Filtering and Analysis**:
   - Remove all tuples from `tuples_list` that consist entirely of None values.

3. **Complex Analysis**:
   - If the modified `text` has a sequence of consecutive uppercase characters longer than in its original form, extract that sequence.
   - For each cleaned tuple in `tuples_list`, if the length of the tuple is equal to the length of the identified uppercase sequence, sort these tuples based on the last element, unless the last element is None, in which case move it to the beginning of the sorted tuples.

4. **Output**:
   - Return a dictionary where:
     - One key is `"uppercase_sequence"`, and its value is a tuple of the identified uppercase sequence and its starting position in `text`, or a message indicating that no new sequence was found.
     - Another key is `"sorted_tuples"`, with its value being the list of sorted tuples.

This question integrates string processing, handling and filtering of data structures, and sorting based on specific conditionsâ€”all skills combined from your provided set of questions.
