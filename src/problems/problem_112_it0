QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a two-dimensional list (list of lists) of integers and a tuple of two integers as input. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each sublist, calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. Sum all these differences together. If this sum falls within the range specified by the two integers in the tuple, return a fixed value, such as 200.

2. Simultaneously, check each sublist to see if each element at an odd index is an odd number. If any element does not satisfy this condition, count the number of even integers located at odd indices across all sublists.

3. If the sum from the first task is within the specified range, add the total count of even numbers located at odd indices to the fixed value before returning it. Otherwise, return the sum of differences.
