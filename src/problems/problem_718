QUESTION

**New Question:**

Combine tuple sorting, series summation, and sequence processing into a single function. Your task is to process a list of strings where each string contains space-separated numerical values and words. Implement a function that does the following:

1. **Extract Tuples:** For each string, extract tuples made up of the last two numbers in each string that appears consecutively. If there are less than two numbers available, disregard that string entirely.

2. **Sort Tuples:** Sort these tuples in increasing order based on the sum of the two numbers in each tuple.

3. **Series Sum Extraction:** From each string, identify blocks of words (sequences separated by spaces) that start with an uppercase letter and find their length. For each word block, calculate the sum of squares of numbers from 1 up to that length and append the result to a corresponding list.

4. **Output:** Return a dictionary with keys as the processed strings and values as a tuple containing the sorted tuple list and the list of series sums for each string.

For example, given the list:
```python
["The 4 quick 3 brown 1 fox 5",
 "Jumps 8 over 2 the 9 lazy 4 dog 3 1",
 "Another 6 5 sentence 7 here 8"]
```
The function should return:
```python
{
 "The 4 quick 3 brown 1 fox 5": ([(1, 5)], [4]), 
 "Jumps 8 over 2 the 9 lazy 4 dog 3 1": ([(9, 3), (4, 3)], [6]), 
 "Another 6 5 sentence 7 here 8": ([(6, 5)], [9])
}
```

Explanation:
- For "The 4 quick 3 brown 1 fox 5": The tuple from "1 fox 5" is extracted and sorted. The block "The" (1 letter) results in a series sum of 1²=1.
- For "Jumps 8 over 2 the 9 lazy 4 dog 3 1": The tuples "9 lazy 4" (sum=13) and "4 dog 3" (sum=7) are extracted and sorted. The block "Jumps" (5 letters) results in a series sum of 1²+2²+3²+4²+5²=55.
- For "Another 6 5 sentence 7 here 8": The tuple "6 5" is extracted. The block "Another sentence here" has 3 words with sums 1²+2²+3²=14.
