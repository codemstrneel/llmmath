QUESTION

Write a function that cyclically shifts each string in a given list to the left by a specified number of characters. After shifting each string, use regex to check if any specific substring is present in any of the shifted strings and return a list of booleans indicating the presence or absence of the substring in each shifted string.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the failed test cases, let's analyze the solution. The problem requires checking for a substring in cyclically shifted strings using regular expressions.

The initial `test_solution_basic_shift` and `test_solution_shift_equals_length` failed. The possible reasons could be misunderstandings between the expected shifted outputs and the checks being made in the assertions. We'll correct these by ensuring our regex pattern checks align with the expected results after correct cyclic shifts.

We will revise the test cases to align them correctly with the expected behavior:

1. Correct `test_solution_basic_shift` to ensure the test case properly verifies the expected condition.
2. Correct `test_solution_shift_equals_length` to ensure the expected cyclic behavior when the shift length equals the string length.
3. Review all added test conditions to avoid incorrect expectations in regex patterns.
   
Here's the revised version:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
import re

def solution(strings, shift, substring):
    """
    Cyclically shifts each string in the list to the left by the specified number 
    of characters and checks for the presence of a given substring using regex.

    Parameters:
    strings (List[str]): List of strings to be shifted.
    shift (int): Number of characters to shift each string to the left.
    substring (str): The substring to check for using regex.

    Returns:
    List[bool]: A list of booleans indicating presence (True) or absence (False)
                of the substring in each shifted string.
    """
    def shift_string(s, n):
        if not s:
            return s
        n = n % len(s)  # handle shift values larger than the string length
        return s[n:] + s[:n]

    result = []
    pattern = re.compile(substring)
    for s in strings:
        shifted = shift_string(s, shift)
        if pattern.search(shifted):
            result.append(True)
        else:
            result.append(False)
    return result
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_no_shift():
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 0, "lo") == [True, False]

def test_solution_basic_shift():
    assert solution(["hello", "world"], 2, "ldwo") == [False, True]

def test_solution_large_shift():
    assert solution(["test", "example"], 10, "ex") == [False, True]

def test_solution_no_substring_found():
    assert solution(["python", "java"], 3, "xyz") == [False, False]

def test_solution_empty_strings():
    assert solution(["", ""], 1, "a") == [False, False]

def test_solution_shift_equals_length():
    assert solution(["shift", "string"], 5, "sh") == [True, False]

def test_solution_regexp_special_characters():
    assert solution(["regex-101", "test*"], 4, "x\\-101") == [True, False]

def test_solution_all_matching():
    assert solution(["match", "maybe"], 1, "atch") == [True, False]
```
<|Test End|>

This revised set of tests should better reflect the expected behavior from the solution, considering cyclic shifts and regex substring matches. The shift length exactly equal to the string length means the string should return to its original state, so we should check for `True` or `False` dependent solely on whether the substring is in the original string.
