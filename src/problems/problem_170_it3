QUESTION

Write a function to find two elements from two sorted arrays such that their sum is closest to a given target value.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems the code blocks were formatted incorrectly; hence, they were causing syntax errors. Letâ€™s correct the format and ensure that both the solution and the tests can execute properly. 

We'll also import the function `solution` correctly in the test cases to prevent further compilation issues. Here is the corrected code:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(arr1, arr2, target):
    """
    Find two elements from two sorted arrays such that their sum is closest to the target value.
    :param arr1: List[int] - Sorted list of integers.
    :param arr2: List[int] - Sorted list of integers.
    :param target: int - Target sum value
    :return: Tuple[int, int] - Elements from arr1 and arr2 whose sum is closest to target.
    """
    i, j = 0, len(arr2) - 1
    closest_pair = (arr1[0], arr2[0])
    closest_diff = float('inf')

    while i < len(arr1) and j >= 0:
        current_sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j]
        current_diff = abs(current_sum - target)
        
        if current_diff < closest_diff:
            closest_diff = current_diff
            closest_pair = (arr1[i], arr2[j])
        
        if current_sum < target:
            i += 1
        else:
            j -= 1
            
    return closest_pair
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_general_case():
    arr1 = [1, 4, 5]
    arr2 = [2, 3, 6]
    target = 8
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    possible_solutions = [(5, 3)]
    assert result in possible_solutions
    
def test_single_element_arrays():
    arr1 = [2]
    arr2 = [3]
    target = 5
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    assert result == (2, 3)
    
def test_negative_numbers():
    arr1 = [-5, -3, 0, 3, 5]
    arr2 = [-10, -2, 1, 6, 8]
    target = 1
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    assert result == (3, -2) or result == (0, 1)
    
def test_zeros_in_arrays():
    arr1 = [0, 2, 4]
    arr2 = [-3, 0, 3]
    target = 1
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    assert result == (0, 3) or result == (4, -3)

def test_identical_elements():
    arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
    arr2 = [1, 2, 3]
    target = 5
    result = solution(arr1, arr2, target)
    possible_solutions = [(2, 3), (3, 2)]
    assert result in possible_solutions
```
<|Test End|>

This format should execute without syntax errors. This solution uses the two-pointer approach to find two elements from the arrays whose sum is closest to the target. The test cases aim to cover diverse scenarios to ensure the solution's robustness.
