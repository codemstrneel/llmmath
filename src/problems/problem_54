QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a list of tuples and a mixed list of numbers. Each tuple represents rows with potential month names as their first element. The function should perform the following operations:

1. Sort the list of tuples alphabetically based on the first item of each tuple.
2. Filter the mixed list to find even numbers and ensure no duplicates exist.
3. Return a tuple containing two elements:
   - A list of tuples sorted by month names that occur in months with 31 days.
   - The list of unique even numbers from the mixed list.

Assume the mixed list contains both integers and other types that should be ignored. Consider only standard month names for the sorting and filtering.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To solve the given task, we need to perform multiple operations as described in the question. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Sorting Tuples:** We need to extract relevant tuples whose first element (month name) corresponds to months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). The list should then be sorted alphabetically by these month names.

2. **Filtering Even Numbers:** From the mixed list, extract unique even integers. Any non-integer or non-number should be ignored, and duplicates should be removed to create a list of unique even numbers.

Here is how you can implement the required function:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(tuples_list, mixed_list):
    """
    This function operates on two inputs:
    - tuples_list : A list of tuples where each tuple begins with a month name.
    - mixed_list : A mixed list of numbers from which we need to filter even numbers.
    
    It returns a tuple containing:
    1. A sorted list of tuples including only those whose first element is a month name with 31 days.
    2. A list of unique even numbers from the mixed list.
    """
    # Months with 31 days
    months_31 = {"January", "March", "May", "July", "August", "October", "December"}
    
    # Filter and sort tuples based on month names with 31 days
    sorted_31_day_month_tuples = sorted(
        (tpl for tpl in tuples_list if tpl[0] in months_31),
        key=lambda x: x[0]
    )
    
    # Filter unique even numbers from mixed_list
    unique_evens = sorted(set(x for x in mixed_list if isinstance(x, int) and x % 2 == 0))
    
    return (sorted_31_day_month_tuples, unique_evens)
<|Solution End|>
```

Now, let's write unit tests to verify the solution:

```python
<|Test Begin|>
from solution import solution

def test_with_valid_input():
    tuples_list = [("January", 15), ("March", 10), ("April", 5), ("December", 25)]
    mixed_list = [1, 2, "March", 2, 5, 6, 8, 2, 6, "April"]
    result = solution(tuples_list, mixed_list)
    assert result == ([("December", 25), ("January", 15), ("March", 10)], [2, 6, 8])

def test_with_empty_lists():
    assert solution([], []) == ([], [])
    
def test_with_no_31_day_months():
    tuples_list = [("April", 5), ("June", 20)]
    mixed_list = [3, 1, 5, 7]
    result = solution(tuples_list, mixed_list)
    assert result == ([], [])

def test_with_mixed_list_having_no_integers():
    tuples_list = [("August", 10), ("May", 5)]
    mixed_list = ["hello", None, "world", 2.5]
    result = solution(tuples_list, mixed_list)
    assert result == ([("August", 10), ("May", 5)], [])

def test_with_mixed_elements_in_tuples_list():
    tuples_list = [(None, 7), ("March", 10), (5, "June"), ("January", 15)]
    mixed_list = [1, 4, 2, 10, "hello", 4]
    result = solution(tuples_list, mixed_list)
    assert result == ([("January", 15), ("March", 10)], [2, 4, 10])
<|Test End|>
```

These tests cover various scenarios to ensure the function works correctly with typical and edge cases, ensuring the correct operation of both sorting/filtering for tuples and extracting unique even numbers from the mixed list.
