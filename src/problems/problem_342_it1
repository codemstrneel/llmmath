QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes two inputs: a sorted list where one element is an extra and a single integer representing the target index of a factorial number. The function should return a tuple containing two values: the index of the extra element in the list and the first digit of the factorial of the given integer. Combine iterative and recursive approaches in your solution.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there was an error with the syntax due to misplaced or incorrect tags. Let's correct the syntax issues and refine the solution as needed.

### Solution Update
1. Fix the logic for finding the extra element index.
2. Ensure we have correct index extraction if the extra element is at the end.

The solution will be updated to include a corrected implementation and tests:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(sorted_list, target):
    # Find the index of the extra element in the sorted list
    def find_extra_element_index(sorted_list):
        for i in range(len(sorted_list) - 1):
            if sorted_list[i + 1] != sorted_list[i] + 1:
                return i + 1
        return len(sorted_list) - 1  # In case the extra element is at the end
    
    # Recursive function to calculate factorial
    def factorial_recursive(n):
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
    
    # Calculate the first digit of factorial number
    def first_digit_of_factorial(n):
        fact = factorial_recursive(n)
        return int(str(fact)[0])
    
    extra_element_index = find_extra_element_index(sorted_list)
    first_digit = first_digit_of_factorial(target)
    
    return (extra_element_index, first_digit)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_extra_in_middle():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6], 5) == (3, 1), "Failed on test with extra in middle"

def test_solution_extra_at_start():
    assert solution([0, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == (1, 2), "Failed on test with extra at start"

def test_solution_extra_at_end():
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7], 3) == (6, 6), "Failed on test with extra at end"

def test_solution_extra_in_large_list():
    assert solution(list(range(100)) + [100], 10) == (100, 3), "Failed on test with large list"

def test_solution_factorial_large_n():
    # For 9!, the factorial is 362880, so the first digit is 3
    assert solution([0, 1, 2, 3, 5], 9) == (4, 3), "Failed on test with large factorial number"
    
def test_solution_extra_at_start_large_target():
    # For 15!, the factorial starts with 1
    assert solution([0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 15) == (1, 1), "Failed on test with extra at start and large target"
<|Test End|>

The changes ensure the code and corresponding test cases handle edge cases well, such as the extra element being at both ends and robustly calculate the required outputs.
