QUESTION

Write a function that, given a binary tree where each node contains an integer, returns the maximum product of values from any two unique nodes of the tree. Consider maximizing the product across the node values by traversing the tree efficiently.

SOLUTION/TESTS

I'll address the syntax error and update the solution and tests for correctness.

The problem seems to have arisen from incorrect placement of triple quotes for code marking. Let's revise and format the code properly:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def solution(root):
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        # Get the values from the left and right subtrees and add the current node's value
        return dfs(node.left) + [node.value] + dfs(node.right)
    
    node_values = dfs(root)
    
    # If there are less than two values, we cannot form a product
    if len(node_values) < 2:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate pairwise products to find the maximum
    max_product = 0
    for i in range(len(node_values)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(node_values)):
            product = node_values[i] * node_values[j]
            if product > max_product:
                max_product = product
    
    return max_product
```
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution, TreeNode

def test_two_node_tree():
    # Tree:
    #   2
    #    \
    #     3
    root = TreeNode(2)
    root.right = TreeNode(3)
    assert solution(root) == 6

def test_full_binary_tree():
    # Tree:
    #     1
    #    / \
    #   2   3
    #  / \
    # 4   5
    root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), TreeNode(3))
    assert solution(root) == 15  # Maximum product is 5 * 3 = 15

def test_single_node_tree():
    # Tree:
    #   1
    root = TreeNode(1)
    assert solution(root) == 0  # Cannot form product with a single node

def test_zero_value_node():
    # Tree:
    #   0
    #  / \
    # 3   7
    root = TreeNode(0, TreeNode(3), TreeNode(7))
    assert solution(root) == 21  # Maximum product is 3 * 7 = 21

def test_large_values():
    # Tree:
    #   10
    #  / \
    # 9   8
    root = TreeNode(10, TreeNode(9), TreeNode(8))
    assert solution(root) == 90  # Maximum product is 10 * 9 = 90
```
<|Test End|>

Make sure that the syntax for defining the solution and test sections is correctly formatted. If there were a syntax error in interpreting this, confirming the use of Python multi-line string conventions could fix it.
