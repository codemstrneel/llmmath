QUESTION

Write a function to find three closest elements from three sorted arrays, with the added condition that the function must handle arrays that include negative numbers and zeros, and it should operate efficiently even if the arrays have significantly different lengths (e.g., one is much longer than the others).

SOLUTION/TESTS

The implementation needs to find the three closest elements, one from each of the provided arrays, that minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum of those selected. It seems the solution function and test cases need further refinement to ensure this functionality is properly implemented and tested.

I'll adjust the solution and test cases for accuracy. Let's ensure the solution is correctly finding the closest elements, and test cases are correctly evaluating this logic.

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(arr1, arr2, arr3):
    """
    Find three closest elements from three sorted arrays using a three-pointer approach.
    The function aims to minimize the maximum difference between the chosen elements.
    
    :param arr1: First sorted array (can include negative numbers and zero).
    :param arr2: Second sorted array (can include negative numbers and zero).
    :param arr3: Third sorted array (can include negative numbers and zero).
    :return: A tuple of three integers representing the closest elements, minimizing the difference.
    """
    i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
    closest_triplet = (arr1[0], arr2[0], arr3[0])
    min_diff = float('inf')

    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2) and k < len(arr3):
        current_triplet = (arr1[i], arr2[j], arr3[k])
        current_min = min(current_triplet)
        current_max = max(current_triplet)
        current_diff = current_max - current_min
        
        # Update if found a smaller difference
        if current_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = current_diff
            closest_triplet = current_triplet

        # Move the pointer of the array with the smallest current element
        if current_min == arr1[i]:
            i += 1
        elif current_min == arr2[j]:
            j += 1
        else:
            k += 1

    return closest_triplet

### Changes Made:
1. **Refinement of Solution**: Kept the core solution the same, but ensured it is framed precisely for finding the minimal difference triplet.
   
2. **Test Adjustments**: 
   - Evaluated the correctness by checking the difference between the maximum and minimum of the triplet found by `solution`, ensuring it is minimized.
   - Adjusted tests to better reflect the minimization goal rather than expecting exact tuples due to multiple valid possibilities.

This refinements should ensure that the logic finds the best possible triplet and that the tests properly verify this functionality.
