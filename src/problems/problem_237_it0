QUESTION

Original Question: Write a Python function to left rotate the bits of a given number.

New Question: Write a Python function to left rotate the bits of a given number by a specified number of positions, and ensure it works correctly for both positive and negative integers.

    """
    Left rotates the bits of the given number by the specified number of positions.
    
    :param number: The integer whose bits are to be rotated, can be positive or negative.
    :param bits: The number of bit positions to rotate to the left.
    :return: The integer result of left rotating the bits of the input number.
    """
    # Find the bit length of the number considering both positive and negative numbers
    # Using the bit_length() + 1 handles negative numbers' sign bit 

    if number < 0:
        number = number + (1 << number.bit_length())  # Convert negative to its equivalent positive bit representation

    max_bits = number.bit_length() or 1  # Ensure at least 1 bit to shift on
    
    # Number of bits to consider for rotation
    bits = bits % max_bits  # Normalize the number of rotations to within the bit length

    # Perform the rotation
    rotated_number = (number << bits) | (number >> (max_bits - bits))
    
    # Mask the rotated number to fit within the original bit length
    rotated_number &= (1 << max_bits) - 1
