QUESTION

**New Question:**

Create a function that takes a list of strings as input. Each string represents a sentence where a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" and a URL might be embedded. Your function should achieve the following:

1. Extract any dates and numerical sequences contained within URLs using regular expressions.
2. For each sentence, reverse the order of words, keeping the character order within words unchanged.
3. Identify the longest run of consecutive numerical sequences and uppercase alphabetic sequences from each sentence.
4. Create a dictionary where the keys are the original sentences and the values are tuples comprising the extracted date, and runs (longest numerical and uppercase sequences found).
5. Merge and deduplicate all sentences by reversing them and assigning the latest extraction values to duplicated sentences.
6. Additionally, identify any duplicate sequences of numerical runs found across all sentences and report these in the results, noting their frequency of occurrence.

**Example:**

```python
def analyze_sentences(sentences):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Sample Input
sentences = [
    "The website https://example.com/stats/1234/details was accessed on 2023-07-25.",
    "Please review your account at http://check.us/100/200/300 by 2023-07-25.",
    "Remember to visit http://domain.com/567/activities for updates.",
    "Note: https://randomsite.com/DATE/2023-09-01 has new content!",
]

# Sample Output
# {
#   "accessed was details 1234/stats/com.example://https on 2023-07-25.": ("2023-07-25", ["1234"], []),
#   "at account your review Please by 2023-07-25.": ("2023-07-25", ["100", "200", "300"], []),
#   "activities 567/domain.com/http://visit to Remember for updates.": (None, ["567"], []),
#   "content! new has DATE/2023-09-01.com.randomsite.https://Note": ("2023-09-01", [], ["DATE"]),
#   "Duplicate Numerical Runs": {"1234": 1, "567": 1, "100/200/300": 1}
# }

output = analyze_sentences(sentences)
print(output)
```

In this problem, you will apply techniques from string manipulation, regex-based data extraction, dictionary operations, and sequence analysis to derive the desired output.
