QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains both integers and strings, and a tuple containing two integers. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. For each sublist, determine if the list contains an odd index with an odd number and if the first three integers form a valid triangle. If both conditions are met, and the perimeter of this triangle is odd, calculate the area using Heron's formula, rounded to two decimal places. Accumulate this area for all such conditions.

2. For each string in the sublist, extract any numeric values and increment them using the first integer from the tuple. If, after incrementation, all numeric values in the string are odd and the total string length (with only alphanumeric characters) does not exceed the second integer from the tuple, concatenate such strings from all sublists into one final string.

3. Return a dictionary with:
   - "triangle_areas": the total accumulated area of valid triangles with odd perimeters.
   - "filtered_concat": the concatenated string from step 2 which meets all specified conditions.

Assume that each sublist contains at least three integers and that strings contain only alphanumeric characters.

SOLUTION/TESTS

The previous attempts included syntax errors due to incorrect formatting of the solution and test code blocks. Let's correct that by ensuring no extraneous elements like triple backticks are present in the code blocks, adhering to the structure you specified.

Here is the corrected solution and test suite in the specified format:

        return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a

    def calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c):
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        return round(area, 2)

    def extract_incremented_numbers(string, increment):
        numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', string)

        return incremented_numbers

        return all(num % 2 != 0 for num in numbers)

            a, b, c = numbers[:3]
            if is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):
                perimeter = a + b + c
                if odd_index_odd_number and perimeter % 2 != 0:
                    triangle_areas += calculate_triangle_area(a, b, c)

        # Process strings
        for string in strings:
