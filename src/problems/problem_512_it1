QUESTION

Write a Python function that takes a mixed list of items, which could include integers, string representations of angles in degrees within quotation marks, and other random strings. The function should perform the following operations:

1. For each integer:
   - Determine if it is an even number and calculate the sum of squares of the next two even natural numbers.
   - If the integer is odd, check if it is a perfect square and compute the cube of its sum with the next odd natural number.

2. For each string representing an angle within quotation marks, extract the angle using regex and calculate the arc length for that angle, assuming a unit circle (circle with radius 1).

The function should return a dictionary with:
- 'even_results': a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer and its corresponding result, either the sum of squares for even numbers or the cube of the modified sum for perfect square odd numbers.
- 'angle_results': a list of arc lengths for angles extracted from the strings.
- 'ignored_items': a list of any elements from the original list that did not fit into any of the above categories.

For example, given the input list `[4, 7, 'Angle "30"', "Word 'something'", 9, 'Quote "60"', "Random"]`, the function should return:
```python
{
  'even_results': [(4, 52)],
  'odd_results': [(7, False), (9, 343)],
  'angle_results': [0.5235987755982988, 1.0471975511965976],
  'ignored_items': ["Word 'something'", 'Random']
}
```

SOLUTION/TESTS

Based on the provided information, it seems the issue lies in the assumptions about the original solution and possibly test cases having mismatches with the expected output. Let's review the solution and test cases to bring them in alignment with the requirements. 

The primary issues appear to be with the handling of even vs. odd numbers and the output format of the results. Let's break this down and ensure we address the discrepancies in both the solution and the tests based on the given problem description.

1. **Solution Corrections:**
   - Ensure the solution correctly calculates the sum of squares of the next two even natural numbers for even numbers.
   - Correctly compute the cube for perfect squares after adding the next odd natural number for odd numbers.
   - Correctly separate the results into `even_results`, `odd_results`, `angle_results`, and `ignored_items`.

2. **Test Adjustments:**
   - Ensure the tests match the corrected behavior of the solution.
   
Here is the adjusted solution and test cases:

                next_even1 = item + 2
                next_even2 = item + 4

In this correction, I've ensured that the cancellation and addition operations for even and odd numbers are accurately reflected based on the problem description. The test functions are adjusted accordingly to check these requirements.
