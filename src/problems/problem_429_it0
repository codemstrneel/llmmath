QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of integers, a list of strings, and a list of tuples. The function should perform the following tasks:

1. Filter the list of integers to include only numbers that are polite and divisible by an integer present in at least one tuple from the list of tuples (ignore any None values in the tuples).
2. Construct a list of tuples from the filtered integers, where each tuple consists of:
   - The index of the integer in the original list of integers.
   - The integer itself.
   - A concatenation of the corresponding string from the list of strings with an indication of whether the integer at that index has even or odd parity.
3. Ensure that if the list of strings is shorter than the list of integers, the processing is limited to the length of the list of strings.
4. Return the list of constructed tuples, sorted in descending order based on the integer values within the tuples.
