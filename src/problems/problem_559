QUESTION

Write a Python function to find the sum of all natural numbers divisible by 3 within the range l and r.

SOL & TESTS

```python
def sum_of_numbers_divisible_by_3(l, r):
    """
    Returns the sum of all natural numbers divisible by 3 within the range l and r (inclusive).
    
    Parameters:
    l (int): The lower bound of the range (inclusive).
    r (int): The upper bound of the range (inclusive).
    
    Returns:
    int: The sum of all numbers divisible by 3 within the given range.
    """
    # Start from the next number divisible by 3 greater than or equal to l
    start = l if l % 3 == 0 else l + (3 - l % 3)
    
    # End at the largest number divisible by 3 less than or equal to r
    end = r if r % 3 == 0 else r - (r % 3)
    
    # Calculate the sum using the sum of an arithmetic series formula
    if start > end:
        return 0
    
    n = (end - start) // 3 + 1  # Number of terms
    return n * (start + end) // 2
