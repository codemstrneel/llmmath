QUESTION

Create a function that takes a list of mixed data types (including tuples, integers, and other types) and performs the following tasks:

1. Count the number of elements in the list until the first tuple is encountered and return this count.
2. Additionally, check if this identified tuple contains a specified element `k`.
3. If the tuple contains the element `k`, reverse the list up to the position where this tuple is located and return the new list. If not, return the original list without modifications.

This new function should merge the tuple detection and counting concept from Questions 1 and 2, along with the reversal logic from Question 3.

def process_list(lst, k):
    """
    Processes the given list to count elements until a tuple is encountered.
    If the tuple contains the specified element `k`, the list is reversed
    up to the position of the tuple.
    
    Parameters:
    - lst: List containing mixed data types.
    - k: Element to check within the first tuple.
    
    Returns:
    - count until the first tuple or possibly modified list.
