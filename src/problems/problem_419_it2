QUESTION

Write a function that processes a list of integers and a list of tuples. The function should:

1. Use a lambda function to filter out numbers from the list of integers that are divisible by at least one of the integers present in any tuple from the list of tuples (ignoring any None values in those tuples).
2. Calculate and return the even parity (True for even, False for odd) of the count of the filtered numbers.

The solution should accommodate lists of differing lengths and handle tuples with None values appropriately.

SOLUTION/TESTS

It seems there was a syntax error related to improperly formatted code blocks. Let’s revise the solution and the tests, ensuring they correctly implement the specifications given in the task. We need to filter out integers based on divisibility and then determine the even parity of the count of these filtered numbers.

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Filtering Logic**: We should filter the list of integers to include only those integers that are divisible by **at least one** of the numbers present in the tuples (excluding `None` values).
2. **Parity Check**: After filtering, determine the parity of the count of these numbers — even (True) or odd (False).

Here is the revised solution and test set:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(integers, tuples):
    """
    Filters a list of integers based on divisibility by any numbers in tuples
    and returns the parity of the resulting list's count.
    
    Parameters:
    integers (list): List of integers to be filtered.
    tuples (list): List of tuples containing integers and possible None values.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the count of filtered integers is even, False otherwise.
    """
    # Flatten the tuples list and filter out None values
    divisors = {n for t in tuples for n in t if n is not None}

    # Filter integers list: keep elements that are divisible by at least one divisor
    filtered_integers = [x for x in integers if any((d != 0 and x % d == 0) for d in divisors)]
    
    # Determine the parity of the count of filtered integers
    return len(filtered_integers) % 2 == 0
```

<|Test Begin|>
```python
from solution import solution

def test_solution_none_in_tuple():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [(None, 2), (None, None)]) == False

def test_solution_empty_integers():
    assert solution([], [(1, 2), (3, 4)]) == True

def test_solution_empty_tuples():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], []) == True

def test_solution_mixed_case():
    assert solution([10, 15, 20, 25, 30], [(2, None), (None, 5)]) == False

def test_solution_all_filtered():
    assert solution([2, 4, 6, 8], [(2, 3), (None, 4)]) == True

def test_solution_no_filtered():
    assert solution([9, 11, 13, 17], [(2, 3), (None, 4)]) == True

def test_solution_divisors_with_none():
    assert solution([7, 14, 21, 28], [(None, 2), (None, None)]) == False

def test_solution_single_number():
    assert solution([15], [(3,), (None,)]) == True

def test_solution_single_tuple_empty():
    assert solution([9, 18, 27], [(None, None)]) == True
```

### Explanation:
- The `solution` function calculates the divisors by excluding `None` values from tuples.
- The integer list is filtered to keep only those numbers divisible by at least one divisor.
- We determine the parity of the count of numbers remaining after filtering.
- The provided tests cover edge cases including empty inputs, tuples with `None`, and verify that parity is correctly determined.
