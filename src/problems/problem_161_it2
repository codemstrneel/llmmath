QUESTION

Write a function to calculate the arithmetic sum of the first n positive even numbers.

SOLUTION/TESTS

To address the failure in the test `test_solution_large`, let's first verify the formula used in the `solution`. The formula currently implemented is `n * (n + 1)`, which indeed calculates the sum of the first `n` positive even numbers as the nth even number is `2n`, and the formula simplifies correctly from the arithmetic series of even numbers.

The failure suggests reconsideration of the formula or potential test adjustments. Upon verification, the formula used in the `solution` is correct. The test that failed, `test_solution_large`, incorrectly expects the sum 5050 for the first 100 even numbers, however, the sum should actually be 10100 using `n * (n + 1)` which is applicable here.

I will update the questionable test case accordingly. Below is the revised code:

<|Solution Begin|>
def solution(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the first n positive even numbers.

    Args:
    n (int): The count of the first positive even numbers to sum.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the first n positive even numbers.
    """
    return n * (n + 1)
<|Solution End|>

<|Test Begin|>
def test_solution_zero():
    assert solution(0) == 0

def test_solution_one():
    assert solution(1) == 2  # Only the first even number, 2.

def test_solution_two():
    assert solution(2) == 6  # 2 + 4 = 6

def test_solution_five():
    assert solution(5) == 30  # 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30

def test_solution_ten():
    assert solution(10) == 110  # Sum of 2, 4, ..., 20

def test_solution_large():
    assert solution(100) == 10100  # Correct sum of first 100 even numbers
<|Test End|>

The formula `n * (n + 1)` for calculating the sum of the first `n` positive even numbers is correct. Hence, we used it, and now all tests should pass with accurate results.
