QUESTION

Write a function to rotate a given list by a specified number of items to the left direction.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correctly present the solution without additional markdown formatting within the code blocks:

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def solution(lst, n):
    """
    Rotates the list lst to the left by n items.
    """
    if not lst:
        return lst
    n = n % len(lst)  # Handle cases where n is greater than list length
    return lst[n:] + lst[:n]
```
<|Solution End|>
<|Test Begin|>
```python
def test_solution_rotation_normal():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

def test_solution_rotation_no_change():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_solution_rotation_full_circle():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_solution_rotation_single_element():
    assert solution([1], 3) == [1]

def test_solution_rotation_empty_list():
    assert solution([], 3) == []

def test_solution_rotation_more_than_length():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3], 4) == [2, 3, 1]

def test_solution_rotation_negative_rotation():
    # Negative rotations to the left are equivalent to positive rotations to the right
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -1) == [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -6) == [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]  # -6 is equivalent to rotating -1
```
<|Test End|>

This format should work correctly in a Python environment. The solution and the tests are properly structured, removing any extra markdown formatting outside the designated tags. This ensures the code is executed as expected without syntax errors.
