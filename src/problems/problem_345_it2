QUESTION

Write a function that takes three inputs: a list of dictionaries, an integer n, and a sorted array with one extra element compared to another sorted array. The function should perform the following tasks: 

1. Calculate the nth Fibonacci number and use it as a key to sort the list of dictionaries. 
2. Identify and return the index of the extra element in the first array. 
3. Check if any of the sequences contained in the dictionaries, once mapped through a transformation where each integer is replaced by the first digit of its factorial, forms a Fibonacci sequence.

Combine these functionalities and return a tuple containing the sorted list of dictionaries, the index of the extra element, and a list of indices of the dictionaries that match the Fibonacci condition. Use recursion where necessary and apply a map function to transform the sequences.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Thank you for the details regarding the task and observed issues in previous attempts. Let's refine the code to ensure proper functionality, focusing on accurate computation of the nth Fibonacci number, detection of Fibonacci sequences, and correct identification of the extra element in the array.

Here's the revised approach:

### Solution Updates:
1. **Fibonacci Calculation:**
   - We'll use an iterative approach to calculate the nth Fibonacci number for improved efficiency and correctness.

2. **Fibonacci Sequence Check:**
   - The logic should correctly detect sequences conforming to the Fibonacci property after transformation.

3. **Sorting Dictionaries:**
   - We'll use the nth Fibonacci number as the key to sort dictionaries, ensuring checks for the key's existence.

4. **Find Extra Element:**
   - We will ensure accurate detection of the extra elementâ€™s index in unequal arrays.

### Implementation:
Let's implement this corrected approach:

```python
<|Solution Begin|>
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

def find_extra_element_index(arr1, arr2):
    for index in range(len(arr2)):
        if arr1[index] != arr2[index]:
            return index
    return len(arr1) - 1

def first_digit_of_factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return int(str(factorial)[0])

def is_fibonacci_sequence(seq):
    if len(seq) < 3:
        return False
    a, b = seq[0], seq[1]
    for num in seq[2:]:
        if a + b != num:
            return False
        a, b = b, num
    return True

def solution(dictionaries, n, arr1, arr2):
    fib_number = nth_fibonacci(n)
    sorted_dicts = sorted(dictionaries, key=lambda d: d.get(fib_number, next(iter(d.values()))))

    extra_index = find_extra_element_index(arr1, arr2)

    fib_seq_indices = []
    for idx, d in enumerate(sorted_dicts):
        if 'sequence' in d:
            transformed_sequence = list(map(first_digit_of_factorial, d['sequence']))
            if is_fibonacci_sequence(transformed_sequence):
                fib_seq_indices.append(idx)
    
    return (sorted_dicts, extra_index, fib_seq_indices)
<|Solution End|>
```

### Updated Test Cases:
Let's ensure the test cases accurately reflect expectations by testing edge cases and common scenarios:

    arr2 = [1, 2, 4, 5]
    expected = (
        [{'sequence': [1, 1, 2, 3]}, {'sequence': [5, 7, 12]}, {'sequence': [4, 6, 10]}],

        1,
        []
    )
    assert solution(dicts, n, arr1, arr2) == expected

    expected = (
        [{'sequence': [21, 34, 55]}, {'sequence': [13, 21, 34]}, {'sequence': [8, 13, 21]}],
        5,
        []
    )
    assert solution(dicts, n, arr1, arr2) == expected

def test_solution_no_sequences_key():
    dicts = [{'data': [1, 2]}, {'data': [2, 3, 5]}]
    n = 6
    arr1 = [7, 11, 13]
    arr2 = [7, 11]
    expected = (
        [{'data': [1, 2]}, {'data': [2, 3, 5]}],
        2,
        []
    )
    assert solution(dicts, n, arr1, arr2) == expected

def test_factorial_single_digit_n():
    dicts = [{'sequence': [1, 2, 3]}, {'sequence': [5, 8, 13]}]
    n = 2
    arr1 = [1, 4, 5, 6]
    arr2 = [1, 5, 6]
    expected = (
        [{'sequence': [1, 2, 3]}, {'sequence': [5, 8, 13]}],
        1,
        []
    )
    assert solution(dicts, n, arr1, arr2) == expected
<|Test End|>
```

These test cases should now adequately validate all aspects of the solution, focusing on the correctness of Fibonacci calculations and sequence analysis.
