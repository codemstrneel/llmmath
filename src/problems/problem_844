QUESTION

Create a function that simulates scheduling for a multi-purpose event venue where different activities can occur at similar times on different platforms. The function should take a complex input comprising a string detailing the schedule with mixed text for activities and times, along with a list of integer time slots.

### Requirements:

1. **Regex Parsing:** Utilize regular expressions to parse the detailed schedule string. The schedule string includes various activities represented by words and times by numbers. The format could include activities such as "meeting", "concert", and "workshop", each paired with specific start and end times.

2. **Platform Assignment:** Assign activities to available platform slots, ensuring that overlapping activities do not share a platform. The goal is to determine the minimum number of platforms required to accommodate all activities within the given time slots.

3. **Activity Filtering:** Implement conditions to filter which activities can start during a given time slot. If two activities can start at the same time slot and it is impossible to assign them to different platforms, prioritize one based on a secondary criterion like alphabetical order or duration.

4. **Complex Condition Checking:** Incorporate an additional condition such that if the concatenated names of activities scheduled on the same platform exceed a certain length, those names must be split into substrings using regex at uppercase alphabets, ensuring each piece is at least one character long.

5. **Multi-Event Priority Encoding:** Apply an encoding to each activity based on a predefined priority level (e.g., VIP, Standard) which will influence the platform assignment process when conflicts arise. Consider this prioritization when assigning activities, especially when the choice between activities for platform slots is otherwise arbitrary.

6. **Output Format:** Return a tuple containing:
   - The minimum number of platforms needed.
   - A list of platforms, each showing its scheduled activities and their times.
   - A transformed list of activity names split based on the additional condition.

### Input:

- A schedule string, e.g., "9arrivalMeeting 10departureWorkshop 11arrivalConcert".
- A list of allowed time slots, e.g., [9, 10, 11, 12].
- An integer `n` representing the character length constraint for activity concatenation requiring splitting.
- A dictionary of activities mapped to their priority levels, e.g., `{"Meeting": "VIP", "Workshop": "Standard", "Concert": "VIP"}`.

### Example Call:

```python
schedule_events("9arrivalMeeting 10departureWorkshop 11arrivalConcert", [9, 10, 11, 12], 10, {"Meeting": "VIP", "Workshop": "Standard", "Concert": "VIP"})
```

### Output:

Expected structure may be similar to:

```python
(2, 
 [
  {"time_slot": 9, "activities": ["Meeting"]}, 
  {"time_slot": 10, "activities": ["Workshop", "Concert"]}
 ], 
 ["Mee-ting", "Wor-kshop", "Con-cert"]
)
```

This new question integrates core concepts such as regex parsing, scheduling and platform allocation, complex string manipulation, condition checking, and activity prioritization.

    Args:
    - schedule_str (str): A string containing schedule information with activities and times.
    - time_slots (list of int): List of allowed time slots.
    - char_length_limit (int): Maximum length of concatenated activity names before splitting is required.
    - priority_dict (dict): A dictionary mapping activity names to their priority level.
