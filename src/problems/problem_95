QUESTION

New Question: Create a Python function to toggle bits of a given number, excluding the first and the last bit.

SOL & TESTS

<|Solution Begin|>
```python
def toggle_bits(n):
    """
    Toggle all bits of the number n excluding the first and the last bit.
    
    :param n: An integer whose bits are to be toggled
    :return: The integer result after toggling
    """
    # Convert n to binary, strip the '0b' prefix
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # If the length of binary_str is less than 3, toggling inner bits has no effect
    if len(binary_str) < 3:
        # Return the number as is since there's nothing to toggle between the first and last bit
        return n
    
    # Toggle bits excluding the first and the last bit
    toggled_str = (
        binary_str[0] +  # Keep the first bit the same
        ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in binary_str[1:-1]) +  # Toggle the middle bits
        binary_str[-1]  # Keep the last bit the same
    )
    
    # Convert back to integer
    return int(toggled_str, 2)

    # Test with number 10 (binary 1010), expect 1110
    assert toggle_bits(10) == 14
    
    # Test with number 21 (binary 10101), expect 11111
    assert toggle_bits(21) == 31
    
    # Test with number 0, for length less than 3 should return original
    assert toggle_bits(0) == 0
    
    # Test with number 1, for length less than 3 should return original
    assert toggle_bits(1) == 1
    
    # Test with number 2 (binary 10), expect no change due to length less than 3
    assert toggle_bits(2) == 2
    
    # Test with number 4 (binary 100), should toggle to 110
    assert toggle_bits(4) == 6
    
    # Test with number 255 (binary 11111111), expect 10000001
    assert toggle_bits(255) == 129
    
    # Test with number 15 (binary 1111), expect 1001
    assert toggle_bits(15) == 9
