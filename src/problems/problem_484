QUESTION

Here's a novel coding question that combines concepts from the provided questions:

**New Question:**

Write a Python function that takes three parameters: a quadratic equation's coefficients (a, b, c) and a string. The function should perform the following tasks:
1. Determine if the coefficients a, b, and c are consecutive integers.
2. If they are, reverse the words in the given string.
3. If the coefficients are not consecutive, count the lowercase letters in the given string and determine if their count matches the number of steps required to reach the end of an array, where the array is formed by the absolute differences between consecutive coefficients (|b-a|, |c-b|).

This question uniquely combines elements from checking conditions on integers (Question 1), manipulating strings (Questions 3 and 5), and involves array-based logic (Question 2), yielding a comprehensive problem-solving exercise.
