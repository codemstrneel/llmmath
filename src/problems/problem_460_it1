QUESTION

Write a function that rotates each sublist within a given list of lists by a specified number of items to the right and then computes the maximum product of three numbers from each rotated sublist. The function should handle sublists containing both positive and negative integers and should return an appropriate error if any sublist contains fewer than three elements.

SOLUTION/TESTS

Let's correct the solution and ensure the unit test properly evaluates the functionality of rotating sublists and computing the maximum product. We need to address why `test_rotation_and_max_product` failed during execution. Let's ensure that the rotation logic is correctly applied and validate the expected results accurately.

    :param list_of_lists: A list of lists containing integers.

<|Test End|>

These tests should now capture the functionality of the solution, test edge cases, and correctly validate the expected maximum product calculations after rotating the sublists by specified amounts.
