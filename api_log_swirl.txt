Please mutate this question to increase the difficulty of it. The new question should be sufficiently different and not be a paraphrased version of the original question. Do not provide any hints, solutions or outputs. Only one new instruction is allowed. Additionally, generate rationales for what changes you have made, and how these make the problem harder or more correct.

**Rationales:**
* **Increased Complexity:** The original question is relatively straightforward. The new question requires the user to consider the logic of excluding words from the analysis. This introduces a layer of complexity by requiring the user to implement a mechanism for filtering out specific words. 
* **Specificity:** The original question is vague about the type of text and the format of the output. The new question specifies that the function should handle a "specified text" and provide an output that is a dictionary of elements and their counts. This adds specificity and requires the user to consider the structure of the output.
* **Real-world Application:** The original question is abstract. The new question implicitly suggests a real-world application by requiring the user to consider the exclusion of specific words. This makes the problem more relevant and engaging.
* **Problem-Solving Skills:** The new question requires the user to think about how to implement a filtering mechanism, which is a more advanced problem-solving skill than simply finding the most common elements.

Please generate unit tests that can be used to verify a solution to this problem in the format within the specified section below. The entire chat history of your previous attempts to generate questions and unit tests is presented below in the "Chat History" section below. Please place the problem in the appropriate tags in the template; you may modify it to more appropriately match edge-cases in the tests, but do not change the core idea of the problem. Ensure your code is within code blocks. For the tests, use pytest style by defining individual test functions (without classes) and using assert statements. Your tests should be implementation independent and assume the solution function is called "solution".
